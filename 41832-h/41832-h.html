        deeply influenced the religious, social, and political life of the
        Oceanic islanders, both Polynesians and Melanesians, particularly by
        inculcating a superstitious veneration for the persons of nobles and
        the rights of private property. When about the year 1886 my
        ever-lamented friend William Robertson Smith asked me to write an
        article on Taboo for the Ninth Edition of the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Encyclopaedia
        Britannica</span></span>, I shared what I believe to have been at the
        time the current view of anthropologists, that the institution in
        question was confined to the brown and black races of the Pacific.
        But an attentive study of the accounts given of Taboo by observers
        who wrote while it still flourished in Polynesia soon led me to
        modify that view. The analogies which the system presents to the
        superstitions, not only of savages elsewhere, but of the civilised
        races of antiquity, were too numerous and too striking to be
        overlooked; and I came to the conclusion that Taboo is only one of a
        number of similar systems of superstition which among many, perhaps
        among all races of men have contributed in large measure, under many
        different names and with many variations of detail, to build up the
        complex fabric of society in all the various sides or elements of it
        which we describe as religious, social, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> political, moral and economic. This conclusion
        I briefly indicated in my article. My general views on the subject
        were accepted by my friend Robertson Smith and applied by him in his
        celebrated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Lectures</span></span> to the elucidation of
        some aspects of Semitic religion. Since then the importance of Taboo
        and of systems like it in the evolution of religion and morality, of
        government and property, has been generally recognised and has indeed
        become a commonplace of anthropology.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The present volume
        is merely an expansion of the corresponding chapter in the first
        edition of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">The Golden Bough</span></span>. It treats of the
        principles of taboo in their special application to sacred
        personages, such as kings and priests, who are the proper theme of
        the book. It does not profess to handle the subject as a whole, to
        pursue it into all its ramifications, to trace the manifold
        influences which systems of this sort have exerted in moulding the
        multitudinous forms of human society. A treatise which should
        adequately discuss these topics would far exceed the limits which I
        have prescribed for myself in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">The Golden Bough</span></span>. For example, I
        have barely touched in passing on the part which these superstitions
        have played in shaping the moral ideas and directing the moral
        practice of mankind, a profound subject fraught perhaps with
        momentous issues for the time when men shall seriously set themselves
        to revise their ethical code in the light of its origin. For that the
        ethical like the legal code of a people stands in need of constant
        revision will hardly be disputed by any attentive and dispassionate
        observer. The old view that the principles of right and wrong are
        immutable and eternal is no longer tenable. The moral world is as
        little exempt as the physical world from the law of ceaseless change,
        of perpetual flux. Contemplate the diversities, the inconsistencies,
        the contradictions of the ethical ideas and the ethical practice, not
        merely of different peoples in different countries, but of the same
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevii">[pg vii]</span><a name="Pgvii"
        id="Pgvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> people in the same country in
        different ages, then say whether the foundations of morality are
        eternally fixed and unchanging. If they seem so to us, as they have
        probably seemed to men in all ages who did not extend their views
        beyond the narrow limits of their time and country, it is in all
        likelihood merely because the rate of change is commonly so slow that
        it is imperceptible at any moment and can only be detected by a
        comparison of accurate observations extending over long periods of
        time. Such a comparison, could we make it, would probably convince us
        that if we speak of the moral law as immutable and eternal, it can
        only be in the relative or figurative sense in which we apply the
        same words to the outlines of the great mountains, by comparison with
        the short-lived generations of men. The mountains, too, are passing
        away, though we do not see it; nothing is stable and abiding under or
        above the sun. We can as little arrest the process of moral evolution
        as we can stay the sweep of the tides or the courses of the
        stars.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore, whether
        we like it or not, the moral code by which we regulate our conduct is
        being constantly revised and altered: old rules are being silently
        expunged and new rules silently inscribed in the palimpsest by the
        busy, the unresting hand of an invisible scribe. For unlike the
        public and formal revision of a legal code, the revision of the moral
        code is always private, tacit, and informal. The legislators who make
        and the judges who administer it are not clad in ermine and scarlet,
        their edicts are not proclaimed with the blare of trumpets and the
        pomp of heraldry. We ourselves are the lawgivers and the judges: it
        is the whole people who make and alter the ethical standard and judge
        every case by reference to it. We sit in the highest court of appeal,
        judging offenders daily, and we cannot if we would rid ourselves of
        the responsibility. All that we can do is to take as clear and
        comprehensive a view as possible of the evidence, lest from too
        narrow and partial a view we <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> should do injustice, perhaps gross and
        irreparable injustice, to the prisoners at the bar. Few things,
        perhaps, can better guard us from narrowness and illiberality in our
        moral judgments than a survey of the amazing diversities of ethical
        theory and practice which have been recorded among the various races
        of mankind in different ages; and accordingly the Comparative Method
        applied to the study of ethical phenomena may be expected to do for
        morality what the same method applied to religious phenomena is now
        doing for religion, by enlarging our mental horizon, extending the
        boundaries of knowledge, throwing light on the origin of current
        beliefs and practices, and thereby directly assisting us to replace
        what is effete by what is vigorous, and what is false by what is
        true. The facts which I have put together in this volume as well as
        in some of my other writings may perhaps serve as materials for a
        future science of Comparative Ethics. They are rough stones which
        await the master-builder, rude sketches which more cunning hands than
        mine may hereafter work up into a finished picture.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At a certain
          stage of early society the king or priest is often thought to be
          endowed with supernatural powers or to be an incarnation of a
          deity, and consistently with this belief the course of nature is
          supposed to be more or less under his control, and he is held
          responsible for bad weather, failure of the crops, and similar
          calamities.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href=
          "#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> To some
          extent it appears to be assumed that the king's power over nature,
          like that over his subjects and slaves, is exerted through definite
          acts of will; and therefore if drought, famine, pestilence, or
          storms arise, the people attribute the misfortune to the negligence
          or guilt of their king, and punish him accordingly with stripes and
          bonds, or, if he remains obdurate, with deposition and death.<a id=
          "noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
          Sometimes, however, the course of nature, while regarded as
          dependent on the king, is supposed to be partly independent of his
          will. His person is considered, if we may express it so, as the
          dynamical centre of the universe, from which lines of force radiate
          to all quarters of the heaven; so that any motion of his—the
          turning of his head, the lifting of his hand—instantaneously
          affects and may seriously disturb some part of nature. He is the
          point of support on which hangs the balance of the world, and the
          slightest irregularity on his part may overthrow the delicate
          equipoise. The greatest care must, therefore, be taken both by and
          of him; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg
          002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and his whole life, down to its minutest details, must be so
          regulated that no act of his, voluntary or involuntary, may
          disarrange or upset the established order of nature. Of this class
          of monarchs the Mikado or Dairi, the spiritual emperor of Japan, is
          or rather used to be a typical example. He is an incarnation of the
          sun goddess, the deity who rules the universe, gods and men
          included; once a year all the gods wait upon him and spend a month
          at his court. During that month, the name of which means
          <span class="tei tei-q">“without gods,”</span> no one frequents the
          temples, for they are believed to be deserted.<a id="noteref_3"

          Mikado receives from his people and assumes in his official
          proclamations and decrees the title of <span class=

          more particularly those who sit on the throne, are looked upon as
          persons most holy in themselves, and as Popes by birth. And, in
          order to preserve these advantageous notions in the minds of their
          subjects, they are obliged to take an uncommon care of their sacred
          persons, and to do such things, which, examined according to the
          customs of other nations, would be thought ridiculous and
          impertinent. It will not be improper to give a few instances of it.
          He thinks that it would be very prejudicial to his dignity and
          holiness to touch the ground with his feet; for this reason when he
          intends to go anywhere, he must be carried thither on men's
          shoulders. Much less will they suffer that he should expose his
          sacred person to the open air, and the sun is not thought worthy to
          shine on his head. There is such a holiness ascribed to all the
          parts of his body that he dares to cut off neither his hair, nor
          his beard, nor his nails. However, lest he should grow too dirty,
          they may clean him in the night when he is asleep; because, they
          say, that which is taken from his body at that time, hath been
          stolen from him, and that such a theft doth not prejudice his
          holiness or dignity. In ancient times, he was obliged to sit on the
          throne for some hours every morning, with the imperial crown on his
          head, but to sit altogether like a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          feet, head or eyes, nor indeed any part of his body, because, by
          this means, it was thought that he could preserve peace and
          tranquillity in his empire; for if, unfortunately, he turned
          himself on one side or the other, or if he looked a good while
          towards any part of his dominions, it was apprehended that war,
          famine, fire, or some other great misfortune was near at hand to
          desolate the country. But it having been afterwards discovered,
          that the imperial crown was the palladium, which by its
          immobility<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href=
          "#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> could
          preserve peace in the empire, it was thought expedient to deliver
          his imperial person, consecrated only to idleness and pleasures,
          from this burthensome duty, and therefore the crown is at present
          placed on the throne for some hours every morning. His victuals
          must be dressed every time in new pots, and served at table in new
          dishes: both are very clean and neat, but made only of common clay;
          that without any considerable expense they may be laid aside, or
          broke, after they have served once. They are generally broke, for
          fear they should come into the hands of laymen, for they believe
          religiously, that if any layman should presume to eat his food out
          of these sacred dishes, it would swell and inflame his mouth and
          throat. The like ill effect is dreaded from the Dairi's sacred
          habits; for they believe that if a layman should wear them, without
          the Emperor's express leave or command, they would occasion
          swellings and pains in all parts of his body.”</span> To the same
          effect an earlier account of the Mikado says: <span class=

          even to touch the ground with his foot. The sun and moon were not
          even permitted to shine upon his head. None of the superfluities of
          the body were ever taken from him, neither his hair, his beard, nor

          a fetish or spirit called Bagba, who is of great importance for the
          whole of the surrounding country. The power of giving or
          withholding rain is ascribed to him, and he is lord of the winds,
          including the Harmattan, the dry, hot wind which blows from the
          interior. His priest dwells in a house on the highest peak of the

          chief of the land, the rule of the fetish forbids him ever to leave
          the mountain, and he must spend the whole of his life on its
          summit. Only once a year may he come down to make purchases in the

          and all-powerful in heaven. Hence before they would taste the new
          crops they offered him the first-fruits, fearing that manifold
          misfortunes would befall them if they broke this rule. When he left
          his residence to visit other places within his jurisdiction, all
          married people had to observe strict continence the whole time he
          was out; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg
          006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          for it was supposed that any act of incontinence would prove fatal
          to him. And if he were to die a natural death, they thought that
          the world would perish, and the earth, which he alone sustained by
          his power and merit, would immediately be annihilated.<a id=

          Similarly in Humbe, a kingdom of Angola, the incontinence of young
          people under the age of puberty used to be a capital crime, because
          it was believed to entail the death of the king within the year. Of
          late the death penalty has been commuted for a fine of ten oxen
          inflicted on each of the culprits. This commutation has attracted
          thousands of dissolute youth to Humbe from the neighbouring tribes,
          among whom the old penalty is still rigorously exacted.<a id=

          Amongst the semi-barbarous nations of the New World, at the date of
          the Spanish conquest, there were found hierarchies or theocracies
          like those of Japan;<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=

          particular, the high pontiff of the Zapotecs in Southern Mexico
          appears to have presented a close parallel to the Mikado. A
          powerful rival to the king himself, this spiritual lord governed
          Yopaa, one of the chief cities of the kingdom, with absolute
          dominion. It is impossible, we are told, to overrate the reverence
          in which he was held. He was looked on as a god whom the earth was
          not worthy to hold nor the sun to shine upon. He profaned his
          sanctity if he even touched the ground with his foot. The officers
          who bore his palanquin on their shoulders were members of the
          highest families; he hardly deigned to look on anything around him;
          and all who met him fell with their faces to the earth, fearing
          that death would overtake them if they saw even his shadow. A rule
          of continence was regularly imposed on the Zapotec priests,
          especially upon the high pontiff; but <span class="tei tei-q">“on
          certain days in each year, which were generally celebrated with
          feasts and dances, it was customary for the high priest to become
          drunk. While in this state, seeming to belong neither to heaven nor
          to earth, one of the most beautiful of the virgins consecrated to
          the service of the gods was brought to him.”</span> If the child

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wherever, as in
          Japan and West Africa, it is supposed that the order of nature, and
          even the existence of the world, is bound up with the life of the
          king or priest, it is clear that he must be regarded by his
          subjects as a source both of infinite blessing and of infinite
          danger. On the one hand, the people have to thank him for the rain
          and sunshine which foster the fruits of the earth, for the wind
          which brings ships to their coasts, and even for the solid ground
          beneath their feet. But what he gives he can refuse; and so close
          is the dependence of nature on his person, so delicate the balance
          of the system of forces whereof he is the centre, that the least
          irregularity on his part may set up a tremor which shall shake the
          earth to its foundations. And if nature may be disturbed by the
          slightest involuntary act of the king, it is easy to conceive the
          convulsion which his death might provoke. The natural death of the
          Chitomé, as we have seen, was thought to entail the destruction of
          all things. Clearly, therefore, out of a regard for their own
          safety, which might be imperilled by any rash act of the king, and
          still more by his death, the people will exact of their king or
          priest a strict conformity to those rules, the observance of which
          is deemed necessary for his own preservation, and consequently for
          the preservation of his people and the world. The idea that early
          kingdoms are despotisms in which the people exist only for the
          sovereign, is wholly inapplicable to the monarchies we are
          considering. On the contrary, the sovereign in them exists only for
          his subjects; his life is only valuable so long as he discharges
          the duties of his position by ordering the course of nature for his
          people's benefit. So soon as he fails to do so, the care, the
          devotion, the religious homage which they had hitherto lavished on
          him cease and are changed into hatred and contempt; he is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name=
          "Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dismissed
          ignominiously, and may be thankful if he escapes with his life.
          Worshipped as a god one day, he is killed as a criminal the next.
          But in this changed behaviour of the people there is nothing
          capricious or inconsistent. On the contrary, their conduct is
          entirely of a piece. If their king is their god, he is or should be
          also their preserver; and if he will not preserve them, he must
          make room for another who will. So long, however, as he answers
          their expectations, there is no limit to the care which they take
          of him, and which they compel him to take of himself. A king of
          this sort lives hedged in by a ceremonious etiquette, a network of
          prohibitions and observances, of which the intention is not to
          contribute to his dignity, much less to his comfort, but to
          restrain him from conduct which, by disturbing the harmony of
          nature, might involve himself, his people, and the universe in one
          common catastrophe. Far from adding to his comfort, these
          observances, by trammelling his every act, annihilate his freedom
          and often render the very life, which it is their object to
          preserve, a burden and sorrow to him.</p>

          slopes, lie the scattered huts and yam-fields of Riabba, the
          capital of the native king of Fernando Po. This mysterious being
          lives in the lowest depths of the crater, surrounded by a harem of
          forty women, and covered, it is said, with old silver coins. Naked
          savage as he is, he yet exercises far more influence in the island
          than the Spanish governor at Santa Isabel. In him the conservative
          spirit of the Boobies or aboriginal inhabitants of the island is,

          He has never seen a white man and, according to the firm conviction
          of all the Boobies, the sight of a pale face would cause his
          instant death. He cannot bear to look upon the sea; indeed it is
          said that he may never see it even in the distance, and that
          therefore he wears away his life with shackles on his legs in the
          dim twilight of his hut. Certain it is that he has never set foot
          on the beach. With the exception of his musket and knife, he uses

          ride a dirty black-heeled horse across Magh Maistean. The king of

          making peace on All-Hallows Day, nor go in a speckled garment on a
          grey speckled steed to the heath of Dal Chais, nor repair to an
          assembly of women at Seaghais, nor sit in autumn on the sepulchral
          mounds of the wife of Maine, nor contend in running with the rider
          of a grey one-eyed horse at Ath Gallta between two posts. The king
          of Ulster was forbidden to attend the horse fair at Rath Line among
          the youths of Dal Araidhe, to listen to the fluttering of the
          flocks of birds of Linn Saileach after sunset, to celebrate the
          feast of the bull of Daire-mic-Daire, to go into Magh Cobha in the
          month of March, and to drink of the water of Bo Neimhidh between
          two darknesses. If the kings of Ireland strictly observed these and
          many other customs, which were enjoined by immemorial usage, it was
          believed that they would never meet with mischance or misfortune,
          and would live for ninety years without experiencing the decay of
          old age; that no epidemic or mortality would occur during their
          reigns; and that the seasons would be favourable and the earth
          yield its fruit in abundance; whereas, if they set the ancient
          usages at naught, the country would be visited with plague, famine,
          and bad weather.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href=

          behest of an oracle. At an elaborate ceremony of installation he is
          anointed, a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg

          rice and oil every new moon; and he sacrifices on behalf of the
          town to the dead and to demons. Nominally his power is very great,
          but in practice it is very limited; for he dare not defy public
          opinion, and he is held responsible, even with his life, for any
          adversity that befalls the country. It is expected of him that he
          should cause the earth to bring forth abundantly, the people to be
          healthy, war to be driven far away, and witchcraft to be kept in
          abeyance. His life is trammelled by the observance of certain
          restrictions or taboos. Thus he may not sleep in any house but his
          own official residence, which is called the <span class=

          of anointing him at inauguration. He may not drink water on the
          highway. He may not eat while a corpse is in the town, and he may
          not mourn for the dead. If he dies while in office, he must be
          buried at dead of night; few may hear of his burial, and none may
          mourn for him when his death is made public. Should he have fallen
          a victim to the poison ordeal by drinking a decoction of sassywood,
          as it is called, he must be buried under a running stream of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Todas
          of Southern India the holy milkman (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">palol</span></span>), who acts as priest of
          the sacred dairy, is subject to a variety of irksome and burdensome
          restrictions during the whole time of his incumbency, which may
          last many years. Thus he must live at the sacred dairy and may
          never visit his home or any ordinary village. He must be celibate;
          if he is married he must leave his wife. On no account may any
          ordinary person touch the holy milkman or the holy dairy; such a
          touch would so defile his holiness that he <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> would forfeit his office. It is only on two
          days a week, namely Mondays and Thursdays, that a mere layman may
          even approach the milkman; on other days if he has any business
          with him, he must stand at a distance (some say a quarter of a
          mile) and shout his message across the intervening space. Further,
          the holy milkman never cuts his hair or pares his nails so long as
          he holds office; he never crosses a river by a bridge, but wades
          through a ford and only certain fords; if a death occurs in his
          clan, he may not attend any of the funeral ceremonies, unless he
          first resigns his office and descends from the exalted rank of
          milkman to that of a mere common mortal. Indeed it appears that in
          old days he had to resign the seals, or rather the pails, of office
          whenever any member of his clan departed this life. However, these
          heavy restraints are laid in their entirety only on milkmen of the
          very highest class.<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href=
          "#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> Among
          the Todas there are milkmen and milkmen; and some of them get off
          more lightly in consideration of their humbler station in
          life.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href=
          "#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> Still,
          apart from the dignity they enjoy, the lot even of these other
          milkmen is not altogether a happy one. Thus, for example, at a
          place called Kanodrs there is a dairy-temple of a conical form. The
          milkman who has charge of it must be celibate during the tenure of
          his office: he must sleep in the calves' house, a very flimsy
          structure with an open door and a fire-place that gives little
          heat: he may wear only one very scanty garment: he must take his
          meals sitting on the outer wall which surrounds the dairy: in
          eating he may not put his hand to his lips, but must throw the food
          into his mouth; and in drinking he may not put to his lips the leaf
          which serves as a cup, he must tilt his head back and pour the
          liquid into his mouth in a jet from above. With the exception of a
          single layman, who is allowed to bear the milkman company, but who
          is also bound to celibacy and has a bed rigged up for him in the
          calves' house, no other person is allowed to go near this very
          sacred dairy under any pretext whatever. No wonder that some years
          ago the dairy was unoccupied and the office of milkman <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> stood vacant. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“At the present time,”</span> says Dr. Rivers,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a dairyman is appointed about once a year
          and holds office for thirty or forty days only. So far as I could
          ascertain, the failure to occupy the dairy constantly is due to the
          very considerable hardships and restrictions which have to be
          endured by the holder of the office of dairyman, and the time is
          probably not far distant when this dairy, one of the most sacred
          among the Todas, will cease altogether to be used.”</span><a id=

          from whose nerveless fingers the reins of government slipped into
          the firmer grasp of men who were often content to wield the reality
          of sovereignty without its name. In some countries this rift in the
          supreme power deepened into a total and permanent separation of the
          spiritual and temporal powers, the old royal house retaining their
          purely religious functions, while the civil government passed into

          sought to thrust upon him; a ferocious chief has been known to go
          about <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name=
          "Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> constantly armed,

          throne.<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href=

          savage Timmes of Sierra Leone, who elect their king, reserve to
          themselves the right of beating him on the eve of his coronation;
          and they avail themselves of this constitutional privilege with
          such hearty goodwill that sometimes the unhappy monarch does not
          long survive his elevation to the throne. Hence when the leading
          chiefs have a spite at a man and wish to rid themselves of him,
          they elect him king.<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href=

          Formerly, before a man was proclaimed king of Sierra Leone, it used
          to be the custom to load him with chains and thrash him. Then the
          fetters were knocked off, the kingly robe was placed on him, and he
          received in his hands the symbol of royal dignity, which was
          nothing but the axe of the executioner.<a id="noteref_53" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> It is
          not therefore surprising to read that in Sierra Leone, where such
          customs have prevailed, <span class="tei tei-q">“except among the
          Mandingoes and Suzees, few kings are natives of the countries they
          govern. So different are their ideas from ours, that very few are
          solicitous of the honour, and competition is very seldom heard
          of.”</span><a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href=

          Another writer on Sierra Leone tells us that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the honour of reigning, so much coveted in Europe, is
          very frequently rejected in Africa, on account of the expense
          attached to it, which sometimes greatly exceeds the revenues of the
          crown.”</span><a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href=

          reluctance to accept the sovereignty in the Ethiopian kingdom of
          Gingiro was simulated, if not really felt, as we learn from the old
          Jesuit missionaries. <span class="tei tei-q">“They wrap up the dead
          king's body in costly garments, and killing a cow, put it into the
          hide; then all those who hope to succeed him, being his sons or
          others of the royal blood, flying from the honour they covet,
          abscond and hide themselves in the woods. This done, the electors,
          who are all great sorcerers, agree among themselves who shall be
          king, and go out to seek him, when entering the woods by means of
          their enchantments, they say, a large <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          down with mighty cries over the place where he is hid, and they
          find him encompass'd by lyons, tygers, snakes, and other creatures
          gather'd about him by witchcraft. The elect, as fierce as those
          beasts, rushes out upon those who seek him, wounding and sometimes
          killing some of them, to prevent being seiz'd. They take all in
          good part, defending themselves the best they can, till they have
          seiz'd him. Thus they carry him away by force, he still struggling
          and seeming to refuse taking upon him the burthen of government,
          all which is mere cheat and hypocrisy.”</span><a id="noteref_56"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mikados of
          Japan seem early to have resorted to the expedient of transferring
          the honours and burdens of supreme power to their infant children;
          and the rise of the Tycoons, long the temporal sovereigns of the
          country, is traced to the abdication of a certain Mikado in favour
          of his three-year-old son. The sovereignty having been wrested by a
          usurper from the infant prince, the cause of the Mikado was
          championed by Yoritomo, a man of spirit and conduct, who overthrew
          the usurper and restored to the Mikado the shadow, while he
          retained for himself the substance, of power. He bequeathed to his
          descendants the dignity he had won, and thus became the founder of
          the line of Tycoons. Down to the latter half of the sixteenth
          century the Tycoons were active and efficient rulers; but the same
          fate overtook them which had befallen the Mikados. Immeshed in the
          same inextricable web of custom and law, they degenerated into mere
          puppets, hardly stirring from their palaces and occupied in a
          perpetual round of empty ceremonies, while the real business of

          throne by an ambitious adventurer named Mack, who from a fisherman
          had risen to be Grand Mandarin. But the king's brother Tring put
          down the usurper and restored the king, retaining, however, for
          himself and his descendants the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          devil-worship, and the ceaseless muttering of meaningless jargon,
          of which the Tibetan form of Buddhism chiefly consists. They
          declare that he is a saint by birth, that he is the direct

          similar custom occasionally practised by the Mikados, in a wish to
          shift to other shoulders the irksome burden of royalty; for in

          was partly hereditary and partly derived from his warlike

          divine chief called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Tooitonga</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Chief of Tonga,”</span> who ranked above the king and
          the other chiefs in virtue of his supposed descent from one of the
          chief gods. Once a year the first-fruits of the ground were offered
          to him at a solemn ceremony, and it was believed that if these
          offerings were not made the vengeance of the gods would fall in a
          signal manner on the people. Peculiar forms of speech, such as were
          applied to no one else, were used in speaking of him, and
          everything that he chanced to touch became sacred or tabooed. When
          he and the king met, the monarch had to sit down on the ground in
          token of respect until his holiness had passed by. Yet though he
          enjoyed the highest veneration by reason of his divine origin, this
          sacred personage possessed no political authority, and if he
          ventured to meddle with affairs of state it was at the risk of
          receiving a rebuff from the king, to whom the real power belonged,
          and who finally succeeded in ridding himself of his spiritual

          king of the Getae regularly shared his power with a priest, whom
          his subjects called a god. This divine man led a solitary life in a
          cave on a holy mountain, seeing few people but the king and his
          attendants. His counsels added much to the king's influence with
          his subjects, who believed that he was thereby enabled to impart to
          them the commands and admonitions of the gods.<a id="noteref_64"

          western Africa two kings reign side by side, a fetish or religious
          king and a civil king, but the fetish king is really supreme. He
          controls the weather and so forth, and can put a stop to
          everything. When he lays his red staff on the ground, no one may
          pass that way. This division of power between a sacred and a
          secular ruler is to be met with wherever the true negro culture has
          been left unmolested, but where the negro form of society has been
          disturbed, as in Dahomey and Ashantee, there is a tendency to
          consolidate the two powers in a single king.<a id="noteref_67"

          for example, there used to be a fetish king at New Calabar who
          ranked above the ordinary king in all native matters, whether
          religious or civil, and always walked in front of him on public
          occasions, attended by a slave who held an umbrella over his head.
          His opinion carried great weight.<a id="noteref_68" name=

          office and the causes which led to its extinction are thus
          described by a missionary who spent many years in Calabar:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The worship of the people is now given
          especially to their various <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idems</span></span>, one of which, called Ndem
          Efik, is a sort of tutelary deity of the country. An individual was
          appointed to take charge of this object of worship, who bore the
          name of King Calabar; and likely, in bypast times, possessed the
          power indicated by the title, being both king and priest. He had as
          a tribute the skins of all leopards killed, and should a slave take
          refuge in his shrine he belonged to Ndem Efik. The office, however,
          imposed certain restrictions on its occupant. He, for instance,
          could not partake of food in the presence of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> any one, and he was prohibited from
          engaging in traffic. On account of these and other disabilities,
          when the last holder of the office died, a poor old man of the
          Cobham family, no successor was found for him, and the priesthood
          has become extinct.”</span><a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69"
          href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> One of
          the practical inconveniences of such an office is that the house of
          the fetish king enjoys the right of sanctuary, and so tends to
          become little better than a rookery of bad characters. Thus on the
          Grain Coast of West Africa the fetish king or Bodio, as he is
          called, <span class="tei tei-q">“exercises the functions of a
          high-priest, and is regarded as protector of the whole nation. He
          lives in a house provided for him by the people, and takes care of
          the national fetiches. He enjoys some immunities in virtue of his
          office, but is subject to certain restrictions which more than
          counterbalance his privileges. His house is a sanctum to which
          culprits may betake themselves without the danger of being removed
          by any one except by the Bodio himself.”</span><a id="noteref_70"

          these Bodios resigned office because of the sort of people who
          quartered themselves on him, the cost of feeding them, and the
          squabbles they had among themselves. He led a cat-and-dog life with
          them for three years. Then there came a man with homicidal mania
          varied by epileptic fits; and soon afterwards the spiritual
          shepherd retired into private life, but not before he had lost an
          ear and sustained other bodily injury in a personal conflict with

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some parts of
          the East Indian island of Timor we meet with a partition of power
          like that which is represented by the civil king and the fetish
          king of western Africa. Some of the Timorese tribes recognise two
          rajahs, the ordinary or civil rajah, who governs the people, and
          the fetish or taboo rajah (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">radja
          pomali</span></span>), who is charged with the control of
          everything that concerns the earth and its products. This latter
          ruler has the right of declaring anything taboo; his permission
          must be obtained before new land may be brought under cultivation,
          and he must perform certain necessary ceremonies when the work is
          being carried out. If drought or blight threatens the crops, his
          help is invoked to save them. Though he ranks below the civil
          rajah, he exercises a momentous influence on the course of events,
          for his secular colleague is bound to consult him in all important
          matters. In some of the neighbouring islands, such as Rotti and
          eastern Flores, a spiritual ruler of the same sort is recognised
          under various native names, which all mean <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“lord of the ground.”</span><a id="noteref_74" name=

          Similarly in the Mekeo district of British New Guinea there is a
          double chieftainship. The people are divided into two groups
          according to families, and each of the groups has its chief. One of
          the two is the war chief, the other is the taboo (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">afu</span></span>) chief. The office of the
          latter is hereditary; his duty is to impose a taboo on any of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name=
          "Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> crops, such as the
          coco-nuts and areca nuts, whenever he thinks it desirable to
          prohibit their use. In his office we may perhaps detect the
          beginning of a priestly dynasty, but as yet his functions appear to
          be more magical than religious, being concerned with the control of
          the harvests rather than with the propitiation of higher powers.
          The members of another family are bound to see to it that the taboo
          imposed by the chief is strictly observed. For this purpose some
          fourteen or fifteen men of the family form a sort of constabulary.
          Every evening they go round the village armed with clubs and
          disguised with masks or leaves. All the time they are in office
          they are forbidden to live with their wives and even to look at a
          woman. Hence women may not quit their houses while the men are
          going their rounds. Further, the constables on duty are prohibited
          from chewing betel nut and drinking coco-nut water, lest the areca
          and coco-nuts should not grow. When there is a good show of nuts,
          the taboo chief proclaims that on a certain day the restriction
          will come to an end.<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href=

          Ponape, one of the Caroline Islands, the kingship is elective
          within the limits of the blood royal, which runs in the female
          line, so that the sovereignty passes backwards and forwards between
          families which we, reckoning descent in the male line, should
          regard as distinct. The chosen monarch must be in possession of
          certain secrets. He must know the places where the sacred stones
          are kept, on which he has to seat himself. He must understand the
          holy words and prayers of the liturgy, and after his election he
          must recite them at the place of the sacred stones. But he enjoys
          only the honours of his office; the real powers of government are
          in the hands of his prime-minister or vizier.<a id="noteref_76"

          examples have taught us that the office of a sacred king or priest
          is often hedged in by a series of burdensome restrictions or
          taboos, of which a principal purpose appears to be to preserve the
          life of the divine man for the good of his people. But if the
          object of the taboos is to save his life, the question arises, How
          is their observance supposed to effect this end? To understand this
          we must know the nature of the danger which threatens the king's
          life, and which it is the intention of these curious restrictions
          to guard against. We must, therefore, ask: What does early man
          understand by death? To what causes does he attribute it? And how
          does he think it may be guarded against?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the savage
          commonly explains the processes of inanimate nature by supposing
          that they are produced by living beings working in or behind the
          phenomena, so he explains the phenomena of life itself. If an
          animal lives and moves, it can only be, he thinks, because there is
          a little animal inside which moves it: if a man lives and moves, it
          can only be because he has a little man or animal inside who moves
          him. The animal inside the animal, the man inside the man, is the
          soul. And as the activity of an animal or man is explained by the
          presence of the soul, so the repose of sleep or death is explained
          by its absence; sleep or trance being the temporary, death being
          the permanent absence of the soul. Hence if death be the permanent
          absence of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg

          soul, the way to guard against it is either to prevent the soul
          from leaving the body, or, if it does depart, to ensure that it
          shall return. The precautions adopted by savages to secure one or
          other of these ends take the form of certain prohibitions or
          taboos, which are nothing but rules intended to ensure either the
          continued presence or the return of the soul. In short, they are
          life-preservers or life-guards. These general statements will now
          be illustrated by examples.</p>

          counterpart or double, with the same features, the same gait, even
          the same dress as the man himself. Many of the monuments dating
          from the eighteenth century onwards represent various kings
          appearing before divinities, while behind the king stands his soul
          or double, portrayed as a little man with the king's features. Some
          of the reliefs in the temple at Luxor illustrate the birth of King
          Amenophis III. While the queen-mother is being tended by two
          goddesses acting as midwives, two other goddesses are bringing away
          two figures of new-born children, only one of which is supposed to
          be a child of flesh and blood: the inscriptions engraved above
          their heads shew that, while the first is Amenophis, the second is
          his soul or double. And as with kings and queens, so it was with
          common men and women. Whenever a child was born, there was born
          with him a double which followed him through the various stages of
          life; young while he was young, it grew to maturity and declined
          along with him. And not only human beings, but gods and animals,
          stones and trees, natural and artificial objects, everybody and
          everything had its own soul or double. The doubles of oxen and
          sheep were the duplicates of the original oxen or sheep; the
          doubles of linen or beds, of chairs or knives, had the same form as
          the real linen, beds, chairs, and knives. So thin and subtle was
          the stuff, so fine and delicate the texture of these doubles, that
          they made no impression on ordinary eyes. Only certain classes of
          priests <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg
          029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          or seers were enabled by natural gifts or special training to
          perceive the doubles of the gods, and to win from them a knowledge
          of the past and the future. The doubles of men and things were
          hidden from sight in the ordinary course of life; still, they
          sometimes flew out of the body endowed with colour and voice, left
          it in a kind of trance, and departed to manifest themselves at a
          distance.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href=

          commonly supposed to escape by the natural openings of the body,
          especially the mouth and nostrils. Hence in Celebes they sometimes
          fasten fishhooks to a sick man's nose, navel, and feet, so that if

          Turik on the Baram River, in Borneo, refused to part with some
          hook-like stones, because they, as it were, hooked his soul to his

          Sea Dyak sorcerer or medicine-man is initiated, his fingers are
          supposed to be furnished with fish-hooks, with which he will

          hooks, it is plain, may be used to catch the souls of enemies as
          well as of friends. Acting on this principle head-hunters in Borneo
          hang wooden hooks beside the skulls of their slain enemies in the
          belief that this helps them on their forays to hook in fresh
          heads.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href=

          for a similar reason the people of Nias, who fear the spirits of
          the recently deceased and identify them with the breath, seek to

          thread or a string is sometimes fastened round the wrist or loins

          the truant into his body by fastening round his wrist a piece of

          threaded; for a magical virtue appears to be ascribed to such
          beads. But lest the string and the bead should be broken and lost,
          he will sometimes tattoo the pattern of the bead on his wrist, and
          this is found to answer the purpose of tethering his soul quite as

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> there are two sick people in a house
          and one of them is at the last extremity, the soul of the other is
          apt to be lured away by the soul of the dying man; hence in order
          to hinder its departure they tie the patient's neck by a string to
          the bands of the sleeping-tent and recite a charm over the string
          so that it may be sure to detain the soul.<a id="noteref_107" name=

          lest the soul of a babe should escape and be lost as soon as it is
          born, the Alfoors of Celebes, when a birth is about to take place,
          are careful to close every opening in the house, even the keyhole;
          and they stop up every chink and cranny in the walls. Also they tie
          up the mouths of all animals inside and outside the house, for fear
          one of them might swallow the child's soul. For a similar reason
          all persons present in the house, even the mother herself, are
          obliged to keep their mouths shut the whole time the birth is
          taking place. When the question was put, Why they did not hold
          their noses also, lest the child's soul should get into one of
          them? the answer was that breath being exhaled as well as inhaled
          through the nostrils, the soul would be expelled before it could
          have time to settle down.<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108"

          it lingers as a metaphor in poetry. But what is metaphor to a
          modern European poet was sober earnest to his savage ancestor, and
          is still so to many people. The Bororos of Brazil fancy that the

          According to the Bilqula or Bella Coola Indians of British Columbia
          the soul dwells in the nape of the neck and resembles a bird
          enclosed in an egg. If the shell breaks and the soul flies away,
          the man must die. If he swoons or becomes crazed, it is because his
          soul has flown away without breaking its shell. The shaman can hear
          the buzzing of its wings, like the buzz of a mosquito, as the soul
          flits past; and he may catch and replace it in the nape of its
          owner's neck.<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href=

          Malays carry out the conception of the bird-soul in a number of odd
          ways. If the soul is a bird on the wing, it may be attracted by
          rice, and so either prevented from taking wing or lured back again
          from its perilous flight. Thus in Java when a child is placed on
          the ground for the first time (a moment which uncultured people
          seem to regard as especially dangerous), it is put in a hen-coop
          and the mother makes a clucking sound, as if she were calling

          Amongst the Battas of Sumatra, when a man returns from a dangerous

          Java also rice is placed on the head of persons who have escaped a
          great danger or have returned home unexpectedly after it had been
          supposed that they were lost.<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117"

          Similarly in the district of Sintang in West Borneo, if any one has
          had a great fright, or escaped a serious peril, or comes back after
          a long and dangerous journey, or has taken a solemn oath, the first
          thing that his relations or friends do is to strew yellow rice on
          his head, mumbling, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cluck! cluck!
          soul!”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">koer, koer, semangat</span></span>). And when
          a person, whether man, woman, or child, has fallen out of a house
          or off a tree, and has been brought home, his wife or other
          kinswoman goes as speedily as possible to the spot where the
          accident happened, and there strews rice, which has been coloured
          yellow, while she utters the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cluck!
          cluck! soul! So-and-so is in his house again. Cluck! cluck!
          soul!”</span> Then she gathers up the rice in a basket, carries it
          to the sufferer, and drops the grains from her hand on his head,
          saying again, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cluck! cluck!

          the intention clearly is to decoy back the loitering bird-soul and

          that a bridegroom's soul is apt to fly away at marriage, so
          coloured rice is scattered over him to induce it to stay. And, in
          general, at festivals in South Celebes rice is strewed on the head
          of the person in whose honour the festival is held, with the object
          of detaining his soul, which at such times is in especial danger of

          the Minangkabauers of Sumatra the old rude notions of the soul seem
          to be dying out. Nowadays most of the people hold that the soul,
          being immaterial, has no shape or form. But some of the sorcerers
          assert that the soul goes and comes in the shape of a tiny man.
          Others are of opinion that it does so in the form of a fly; hence
          they make food ready to induce the absent soul to come back, and
          the first fly that settles on the food is regarded as the returning
          truant. But in native poetry and popular expressions there are
          traces of the belief that the soul quits the body in the form of a
          bird.<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href=

          wakes up from a sound sleep, he is firmly convinced that his soul
          has really been away hunting, fishing, felling trees, or whatever
          else he has dreamed of doing, while all the time his body has been

          causes may detain the sleeper's soul. Thus, his soul may meet the
          soul of another sleeper and the two souls may fight; if a Guinea

          the dead may come to life again if only they can take possession of
          a sleeper's body during the absence of his soul in dreams. Hence,
          when the shades of night have fallen, the ghosts of the departed

          Again, the soul of the sleeper may be prevented by an accident or
          by physical force from returning to his body. When a Dyak dreams of
          falling into the water, he supposes that this accident has really
          befallen his spirit, and he sends for a wizard, who fishes for the
          spirit with a hand-net in a basin of water till he catches it and
          restores it to its owner.<a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132"

          cover it; so the soul could not return to the body and the man
          died. While his friends were preparing to burn the body some one
          uncovered the pitcher to get water. The lizard thus escaped and
          returned to the body, which immediately revived; so the man rose up
          and asked his friends why they were weeping. They told him they
          thought he was dead and were about to burn his body. He said he had
          been down a well to get water, but had found it hard to get out and
          had just returned. So they saw it all.<a id="noteref_133" name=

          trial at Mühlbach in the eighteenth century it is said that a woman
          had engaged two men to work in her vineyard. After noon they all
          lay down to rest as usual. An hour later the men got up and tried
          to waken the woman, but could not. She lay motionless with her
          mouth wide open. They came back at sunset and still she lay like a
          corpse. Just at that moment a big fly came buzzing past, which one
          of the men caught and shut up in his leathern pouch. Then they
          tried again to waken the woman, but could not. Afterwards they let
          out the fly; it flew straight into the woman's mouth and she awoke.
          On seeing this the men had no further doubt that she was a

          without his soul, he would fall sick. If it is absolutely necessary

          him in the face unless his soul could be induced to speed at once
          across the sea and reanimate its deserted tenement. The man would

          Highland story, told to Hugh Miller on the picturesque shores of
          Loch Shin, well illustrates the haste made by the soul to regain
          its body when the sleeper has been prematurely roused by an
          indiscreet friend. Two young men had been spending the early part
          of a warm summer day in the open air, and sat down on a mossy bank
          to rest. Hard by was an ancient ruin separated from the bank on
          which they sat only by a slender runnel, across which there lay,
          immediately over a miniature cascade, a few withered stalks of
          grass. <span class="tei tei-q">“Overcome by the heat of the day,
          one of the young men fell asleep; his companion watched drowsily
          beside him; when all at once the watcher was aroused to attention
          by seeing a little indistinct form, scarce larger than a
          humble-bee, issue from the mouth of the sleeping man, and, leaping
          upon the moss, move downwards to the runnel, which it crossed along
          the withered grass stalks, and then disappeared among the
          interstices of the ruin. Alarmed by what he saw, the watcher
          hastily shook his companion by the shoulder, and awoke him; though,
          with all his haste, the little cloud-like creature, still more
          rapid in its movements, issued from the interstice into which it
          had gone, and, flying across the runnel, instead of creeping along
          the grass stalks and over the sward, as before, it re-entered the
          mouth of the sleeper, just as he was in the act of awakening.
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘What is the matter with you?’</span> said

          which forms a sort of link between the Pyrenees and the Cevennes,
          they tell how a woman, who had long been suspected of being a
          witch, one day fell asleep at noon among the reapers in the field.
          Resolved to put her to the test, the reapers carried her, while she
          slept, to another part of the field, leaving a large pitcher on the
          spot from which they had moved her. When her soul returned, it
          entered the pitcher and cunningly rolled it over and over till the
          vessel lay beside her body, of which the soul thereupon took
          possession.<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in order
          that a man's soul should quit his body, it is not necessary that he
          should be asleep. It may quit him in his waking hours, and then
          sickness, insanity, or death will be the result. Thus a man of the
          Wurunjeri tribe in Victoria lay at his last gasp because his spirit
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">murup</span></span>) had departed from him. A
          medicine-man went in pursuit and caught the spirit by the middle
          just as it was about to plunge into the sunset glow, which is the
          light cast by the souls of the dead as they pass in and out of the
          underworld, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg

          where the sun goes to rest. Having captured the vagrant spirit, the
          doctor brought it back under his opossum rug, laid himself down on
          the dying man, and put the soul back into him, so that after a time
          he revived.<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href=

          Karens of Burma are perpetually anxious about their souls, lest
          these should go roving from their bodies, leaving the owners to
          die. When a man has reason to fear that his soul is about to take
          this fatal step, a ceremony is performed to retain or recall it, in
          which the whole family must take part. A meal is prepared
          consisting of a cock and hen, a special kind of rice, and a bunch
          of bananas. Then the head of the family takes the bowl which is
          used to skim rice, and knocking with it thrice on the top of the
          house-ladder says: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=

          "font-style: italic">Prrrroo!</span></span> Come back, soul, do not
          tarry outside! If it rains, you will be wet. If the sun shines, you
          will be hot. The gnats will sting you, the leeches will bite you,
          the tigers will devour you, the thunder will crush you.
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Prrrroo!</span></span> Come back, soul! Here
          it will be well with you. You shall want for nothing. Come and eat
          under shelter from the wind and the storm.”</span> After that the
          family partakes of the meal, and the ceremony ends with everybody
          tying their right wrist with a string which has been charmed by a
          sorcerer.<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href=

          Similarly the Lolos, an aboriginal tribe of western China, believe
          that the soul leaves the body in chronic illness. In that case they
          read a sort of elaborate litany, calling on the soul by name and
          beseeching it to return from the hills, the vales, the rivers, the
          forests, the fields, or from wherever it may be straying. At the
          same time cups of water, wine, and rice are set at the door for the
          refreshment of the weary wandering spirit. When the ceremony is
          over, they tie a red cord round the arm of the sick man to tether
          the soul, and this cord is worn by him until it decays and drops
          off.<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href=

          among the Kenyahs of Sarawak a medicine-man has been known to
          recall the stray soul of a child, and to fasten it firmly in its
          body by tying a string round the child's right wrist, and smearing
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name=

          Ilocanes of Luzon think that a man may lose his soul in the woods
          or gardens, and that he who has thus lost his soul loses also his
          senses. Hence before they quit the woods or the fields they call to
          their soul, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us go! let us go!”</span>
          lest it should loiter behind or go astray. And when a man becomes
          crazed or mad, they take him to the place where he is supposed to
          have lost his soul and invite the truant spirit to return to his
          body.<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href=

          Mongols sometimes explain sickness by supposing that the patient's
          soul is absent, and either does not care to return to its body or
          cannot find the way back. To secure the return of the soul it is
          therefore necessary on the one hand to make its body as attractive
          as possible, and on the other hand to shew the soul the way home.
          To make the body attractive all the sick man's best clothes and
          most valued possessions are placed beside him; he is washed,
          incensed, and made as comfortable as may be; and all his friends
          march thrice round the hut calling out the sick man's name and
          coaxing his soul to return. To help the wanderer to find its way
          back a coloured cord is stretched from the patient's head to the
          door of the hut. The priest in his robes reads a list of the
          horrors of hell and the dangers incurred by souls which wilfully
          absent themselves from their bodies. Then turning to the assembled
          friends and the patient he asks, <span class="tei tei-q">“Is it
          come?”</span> All answer <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> and
          bowing to the returning soul throw seed over the sick man. The cord
          which guided the soul back is then rolled up and placed round the
          patient's neck, who must wear it for seven days without taking it
          off. No one may frighten or hurt him, lest his soul, not yet
          familiar with its body, should again take flight.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the
          Congo tribes believe that when a man is ill, his soul has left his

          vagrant spirit and restore it to the invalid. Generally the
          physician declares that he has successfully chased the soul into
          the branch of a tree. The whole town thereupon turns out and
          accompanies the doctor to the tree, where the strongest men are
          deputed to break off the branch in which the soul of the sick man
          is supposed to be lodged. This they do and carry the branch back to
          the town, insinuating by their gestures that the burden is heavy
          and hard to bear. When the branch has been brought to the sick
          man's hut, he is placed in an upright position by its side, and the
          sorcerer performs the enchantments by which the soul is believed to
          be restored to its owner.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153"

          soul or shade of a Déné or Tinneh Indian in the old days generally
          remained invisible, but appeared wandering about in one form or
          another whenever disease or death was imminent. All the efforts of
          the sufferer's friends were therefore concentrated on catching the
          roving shade. The method adopted was simple. They stuffed the
          patient's moccasins with down and hung them up. If next morning the
          down was warm, they made sure that the lost soul was in the boots,
          with which accordingly they carefully and silently shod their
          suffering friend. Nothing more could reasonably be demanded for a

          repeated: <span class="tei tei-q">“Come back, O soul, whether thou

          Sometimes the means adopted by the Battas to procure the return of
          a sick person's soul are more elaborate. A procession sets out from
          the village to the tuck of drum to find and bring home the strayed
          soul. First goes a person bearing a basket which contains cakes of
          rice-meal, rice dyed yellow, and a boiled fowl's egg. The sorcerer
          follows carrying a chicken, and behind him walks a man with a
          black, red, and white flag. A crowd of sympathisers brings up the
          rear. On reaching the spot where the lost soul is supposed to
          tarry, they set up a small bamboo altar, and the sorcerer offers on
          it the chicken to the spirit of the place, the drums beating all
          the time. Then, waving his shawl to attract the soul of the sick
          man, he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Come hither, thou soul of
          So-and-So, whether thou sittest among the stones or in the mud. In
          the house is thy place. We have besought the spirit to let thee
          go.”</span> After that the procession reforms and marches back to
          the village to the roll of drums and the clash of cymbals. On
          reaching the door of the house the sorcerer calls out to the
          inmates, <span class="tei tei-q">“Has it come?”</span> and a voice
          from within answers, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is here, good
          sorcerer.”</span> At evening the drums beat again.<a id=

          number of plants, including rice, a species of fig, and garlic, are
          supposed by the Battas to possess soul-compelling virtue and are
          accordingly made use of by them in rites for the recovery of lost
          souls. When a child is sick, the mother commonly waves a cloth to
          beckon home its wandering spirit, and when a cock crows or a hen
          cackles in the yard, she knows that the prodigal has returned. If
          the little sufferer persists in being ill in spite of these
          favourable omens, the mother will hang a bag of rice at the head of
          her bed when she goes to sleep, and next morning on getting up she
          measures the rice. If the rice has increased in volume during the
          night, as it may do in a moisture-laden <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class=

          soul has indeed come home to stay.<a id="noteref_158" name=

          Kayans of Borneo fasten packets of rice, flesh, and fish to the
          window in the roof through which the wandering soul of a sick man
          is expected to return home. The doctor sits cross-legged on a mat
          under the open window with a display of pretty things spread out
          temptingly before him as baits to entice the spirit back to its
          deserted tabernacle. From the window hangs a string of precious
          corals or pearls to serve the returning prodigal as a ladder and so
          facilitate his descent into the house. The lower end of the string
          is attached to a bundle composed of wooden hooks, a fowl's feather,
          little packets of rice, and so forth. Chanting his spells, the
          doctor strokes the soul down the string into the bundle, which he
          then deposits in a basket and hides in a corner till the dusk of
          the evening. When darkness has fallen, he blows the captured soul
          back into the patient's head and strokes the sufferer's arm
          downwards with the point of an old spear in order to settle the
          soul firmly in his body.<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159"

          when a popular traveller was leaving a Kayan village, the mothers,
          fearing that their children's souls might follow him on his
          journey, brought him the boards on which they carry their infants
          and begged him to pray that the souls of the little ones would
          return to the familiar boards and not go away with him into the far
          country. To each board was fastened a looped string for the purpose
          of tethering the vagrant spirits, and through the loop each baby
          was made to pass a chubby finger to make sure that its tiny soul
          would not wander away.<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href=

          a Dyak is dangerously ill, the medicine-men may say that his soul
          has escaped far away, perhaps to the river; then they will wave a
          garment or cloth about to imitate the casting of a net, signifying
          thereby that they are catching the soul like a fish in a net. Or
          they may give out that the soul has escaped into the jungle; and
          then they will rush out of the house to circumvent and secure it
          there. Or again they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg
          048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          may allege that it has been carried away over seas to some unknown
          land; and then they will play at paddling a boat to follow it
          across the great water. But more commonly their mode of treatment
          is as follows. A spear is set up in the middle of the verandah with
          a few leaves tied to it and the medicine-boxes of the medicine-men
          laid at its foot. Round this the doctors run at full speed,
          chanting the while, till one of them falls down and lies
          motionless. The bystanders cover him with a blanket, and wait while
          his spirit hies away after the errant soul and brings it back.
          Presently he comes to himself, stares vacantly about like a man
          awaking from sleep, and then rises, holding the soul in his
          clenched right hand. He then returns it to the patient through the
          crown of his head, while he mutters a spell.<a id="noteref_161"

          the Dyaks of the Kayan and Lower Melawie districts you will often
          see, in houses where there are children, a basket of a peculiar
          shape with shells and dried fruits attached to it. These shells
          contain the remains of the children's navel-strings, and the basket
          to which they are fastened is commonly hung beside the place where
          the children sleep. When a child is frightened, for example by
          being bathed or by the bursting of a thunderstorm, its soul flees
          from its body and nestles beside its old familiar friend the
          navel-string in the basket, from which the mother easily induces it
          to return by shaking the basket and pressing it to the child's
          body.<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href=

          Toboongkoos of Central Celebes believe that sickness in general is
          caused by the departure of the soul. To recover the wanderer a
          priest will set out food in the courtyard of the sufferer's house
          and then invoke the soul, promising it many fine things if it will
          only come back. When he thinks it has complied with his request, he
          catches it in a cloth which he keeps ready for the purpose. This
          cloth he afterwards claps on the sick man's head, thereby restoring
          to him his lost soul.<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href=

          story a king conveys his soul into the dead body of a Brahman, and
          a hunchback conveys his soul into the deserted body of the king.
          The hunchback is now king and the king is a Brahman. However, the
          hunchback is induced to shew his skill by transferring his soul to
          the dead body of a parrot, and the king seizes the opportunity to
          regain possession of his own body.<a id="noteref_164" name=

          tale of the same type, with variations of detail, reappears among
          the Malays. A king has incautiously transferred his soul to an ape,
          upon which the vizier adroitly inserts his own soul into the king's
          body and so takes possession of the queen and the kingdom, while
          the true king languishes at court in the outward semblance of an
          ape. But one day the false king, who played for high stakes, was
          watching a combat of rams, and it happened that the animal on which
          he had laid his money fell down dead. All efforts to restore
          animation proved unavailing till the false king, with the instinct
          of a true sportsman, transferred his own soul to the body of the
          deceased ram, and thus renewed the fray. The real king in the body
          of the ape saw his chance, and with great presence of mind darted
          back into his own body, which the vizier had rashly vacated. So he
          came to his own again, and the usurper in the ram's body met with
          the fate he richly deserved.<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165"

          king.<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href=

          Chinese story we read of a monk in a Buddhist monastery who used
          from time to time to send his soul away out of himself. Whenever he
          was thus absent from the body, he took the precaution of locking
          the door of his cell. On one of these occasions an envoy from the
          north arrived and put up at <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the monastery, but there was no cell for him
          to pass the night in. Then he looked into the cell of the brother
          whose soul was not at home, and seeing his body lying there
          motionless, he battered the door in and said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will lodge here. The man is dead. Take the body and
          burn it.”</span> His servants obeyed his orders, the monks being
          powerless to interfere. That very night the soul came back, only to
          find its body reduced to ashes. Every night it could be heard
          crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Where shall I settle?”</span>
          Those who knew him then opened their windows, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Here I am.”</span> So the soul came in and united
          itself with their body, and the result was that they became much
          cleverer than before.<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href=

          Similarly the Greeks told how the soul of Hermotimus of Clazomenae
          used to quit his body and roam far and wide, bringing back
          intelligence of what he had seen on his rambles to his friends at
          home; until one day, when his spirit was abroad, his enemies
          contrived to seize his deserted body and committed it to the
          flames.<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a> It is
          said that during the last seven years of his life Sultan Bayazid
          ate nothing that had life and blood in it. One day, being seized
          with a great longing for sheep's trotters, he struggled long in
          this glorious contest with his soul, until at last, a savoury dish
          of trotters being set before him, he said unto his soul,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“My soul, the trotters are before thee; if
          thou wishest to enjoy them, leave the body and feed on
          them.”</span> Hardly had he uttered these words when a living
          creature was seen to issue from his mouth and drink of the juice in
          the dish, after which it endeavoured to return whence it came. But
          the austere sultan, determined to mortify his carnal appetite,
          prevented it with his hand from entering his mouth, and when it
          fell to the ground commanded that it should be beaten. The pages
          kicked it to death, and after this murder of his soul the sultan
          remained in gloomy seclusion, taking no part or interest in the
          affairs of government.<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href=

          the soul is not always voluntary. It may be extracted from the body
          against its will by ghosts, demons, or sorcerers. Hence, when a
          funeral is passing the house, the Karens of Burma tie their
          children with a special kind of string to a particular part of the
          house, lest the souls of the children should leave their bodies and
          go into the corpse which is passing. The children are kept tied in

          after the corpse has been laid in the grave, but before the earth
          has been shovelled in, the mourners and friends range themselves
          round the grave, each with a bamboo split lengthwise in one hand
          and a little stick in the other; each man thrusts his bamboo into
          the grave, and drawing the stick along the groove of the bamboo
          points out to his soul that in this way it may easily climb up out
          of the tomb. While the earth is being shovelled in, the bamboos are
          kept out of the way, lest the souls should be in them, and so
          should be inadvertently buried with the earth as it is being thrown
          into the grave; and when the people leave the spot they carry away
          the bamboos, begging their souls to come with them.<a id=

          Further, on returning from the grave each Karen provides himself
          with three little hooks made of branches of trees, and calling his
          spirit to follow him, at short intervals, as he returns, he makes a
          motion as if hooking it, and then thrusts the hook into the ground.
          This is done to prevent the soul of the living from staying behind
          with the soul of the dead.<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172"

          the mother, and that if it is not recovered the child must die. So
          a wise woman is called in to get back the baby's soul. She places a
          mirror near the corpse, and on the mirror a piece of feathery
          cotton down. Holding a cloth in her open hands at the foot of the
          mirror, she with wild words entreats the mother not to take with
          her the <span class="tei tei-q">“butterfly”</span> or soul of her
          child, but to send it back. As the gossamer down slips from the
          face of the mirror she catches it in the cloth and tenderly places
          it on the baby's breast. The same ceremony is sometimes observed
          when one of two children that have played together dies, and is
          thought to be luring away the soul of its playmate to the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Bolang
          Mongondo, a district in the west of Celebes, all sickness is
          ascribed to the ancestral spirits who have carried off the
          patient's soul. The object therefore is to bring back the soul of
          the sufferer and restore it to him. An eye-witness has thus
          described the attempted cure of a sick boy. The priestesses, who
          acted as physicians, made a doll of cloth and fastened it to the
          point of a spear, which an old woman held upright. Round this doll
          the priestesses danced, uttering charms, and chirruping as when one
          calls a dog. Then the old woman lowered the point of the spear a
          little, so that the priestesses could reach the doll. By this time
          the soul of the sick boy was supposed to be in the doll, having
          been brought into it by the incantations. So the priestesses
          approached it cautiously on tiptoe and caught the soul in the
          many-coloured cloths which they had been waving in the air. Then
          they laid the soul on the boy's head, that is, they wrapped his
          head in the cloth in which the soul was <span class="tei tei-pb"

          moments with great gravity, holding their hands on the patient's
          head. Suddenly there was a jerk, the priestesses whispered and
          shook their heads, and the cloth was taken off—the soul had
          escaped. The priestesses gave chase to it, running round and round
          the house, clucking and gesticulating as if they were driving hens
          into a poultry-yard. At last they recaptured the soul at the foot
          of the stair and restored it to its owner as before.<a id=

          For when a man was sick the soul-doctor would go with a large troop
          of men and women to the graveyard. Here the men played on flutes
          and the women whistled softly to lure the soul home. After this had
          gone on for some time they formed in procession and moved
          homewards, the flutes playing and the women whistling all the way,
          while they led back the wandering soul and drove it gently along

          bonnet to the hole, then folded it up and rushed back to the house
          of the sufferer, saying he had a soul for him. With that he clapped

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a Dyak or
          Malay of some of the western tribes or districts of Borneo is taken
          ill, with vomiting and profuse sweating as the only symptoms, he
          thinks that one of his deceased kinsfolk or ancestors is at the
          bottom of it. To discover which of them is the culprit, a wise man
          or woman pulls a lock of hair on the crown of the sufferer's head,
          calling out the names of all his dead relations. The name at which
          the lock gives forth a sound is the name of the guilty party. If
          the patient's hair is too short to be tugged with effect, he knocks
          his forehead seven times against the forehead of a kinsman who has
          long hair. The hair of the latter is then tugged instead of that of
          the patient and answers to the test quite as well. When the blame
          has thus been satisfactorily laid at the door of the ghost who is
          responsible for the sickness, the physician, who, as in other
          countries, is often an old woman, remonstrates with him on his ill
          behaviour. <span class="tei tei-q">“Go back,”</span> says she,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to your grave; what do you come here for?
          The soul of the sick man does not choose to be called by you, and
          will remain yet a long time in its body.”</span> Then she puts some
          ashes from the hearth in a winnowing fan and moulds out of them a
          small figure or image in human likeness. Seven times she moves the
          basket with the little ashen figure up and down before the patient,
          taking care not to obliterate the figure, while at the same time
          she says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sickness, settle in the head,
          belly, hands, etc.; then quickly pass into the corresponding part
          of the image,”</span> whereupon the patient spits on the ashen
          image and pushes it from him with his left hand. Next the beldame
          lights a candle and goes to the grave of the person whose ghost is
          doing all the mischief. On the grave she throws the figure of
          ashes, calling out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ghost, plague the sick
          man no longer, and stay in your grave, that he may see you no
          more.”</span> On her return she asks the anxious relations in the
          house, <span class="tei tei-q">“Has his soul come back?”</span> and
          they must answer quickly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, the soul of
          the sick man has come back.”</span> Then she stands beside the
          patient, blows out the candle which had lighted the returning soul
          on its way, and strews yellow-coloured rice on the head of the
          convalescent, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cluck, soul! cluck,
          soul! cluck, soul!”</span> Last of all she fastens on his right
          wrist a bracelet or ring which he <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a> In
          this case we see that the saving of the soul is combined with a
          vicarious sacrifice to the ghost, who receives a puppet on which to
          work his will instead of on the poor soul. In San Cristoval, one of
          the Melanesian islands, the vicarious sacrifice takes the form of a
          pig or a fish. A malignant ghost of the name of Tapia is supposed
          to have seized on the sick man's soul and tied it up to a
          banyan-tree. Accordingly a man who has influence with Tapia takes a
          pig or fish to the holy place where the ghost resides and offers it
          to him, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is for you to eat in
          place of that man; eat this, don't kill him.”</span> This satisfies
          the ghost; the soul is loosed from the tree and carried back to the
          sufferer, who naturally recovers.<a id="noteref_186" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a
          comparatively easy matter to save a soul which is merely tied up to
          a tree or detained as a vagrant in a pound; but it is a far harder
          task to fetch it up from the nether world, if it once gets down
          there. When a Buryat shaman is called in to attend a patient, the
          first thing he does is to ascertain where exactly the soul of the
          invalid is; for it may have strayed, or been stolen, or be
          languishing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg

          in the prison of the gloomy Erlik, lord of the world below. If it
          is anywhere in the neighbourhood, the shaman soon catches and
          replaces it in the patient's body. If it is far away, he searches
          the wide world till he finds it, ransacking the deep woods, the
          lonely steppes, and the bottom of the sea, not to be thrown off the
          scent even though the cunning soul runs to the sheep-walks in the
          hope that its footprints will be lost among the tracks of the
          sheep. But when the whole world has been searched in vain for the
          errant soul, the shaman knows that there is nothing for it but to
          go down to hell and seek the lost one among the spirits in prison.
          At the stern call of duty he does not flinch, though he knows that
          the journey is toilsome, and that the travelling expenses, which
          are naturally defrayed by the patient, are very heavy. Sometimes
          the lord of the infernal regions will only agree to release the
          soul on condition of receiving another in its stead, and that one
          the soul of the sick man's dearest friend. If the patient consents
          to the substitution, the shaman turns himself into a hawk, pounces
          upon the soul of the friend as it soars from his slumbering body in
          the form of a lark, and hands over the fluttering, struggling thing
          to the grim warden of the dead, who thereupon sets the soul of the
          sick man at liberty. So the sick man recovers and his friend
          dies.<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a shaman
          declares that the soul of a sick Thompson Indian has been carried
          off by the dead, the good physician, who is the shaman himself,
          puts on a conical mask and sets off in pursuit. He now acts as if
          on a journey, jumping rivers and such like obstacles, searching,
          talking, and sometimes engaging in a tussle for the possession of
          the soul. His first step is to repair to the old trail by which the
          souls of heathen Thompsons went to the spirit-land; for nowadays
          the souls of Christian Thompsons travel by a new road. If he fails
          to find the tracks of the lost soul there, he searches all the
          graveyards, one after the other, and almost always discovers it in
          one of them. Sometimes he succeeds in heading off the departing
          soul by taking a short cut to the other world. A shaman can only
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name=
          "Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> stay a short time
          there. So as soon as he lays hands on the soul he is after, he
          bolts with it. The other souls give chase, but he stamps with his
          foot, on which he wears a rattle made of deer's hoofs. At the
          rattle of the hoofs the ghosts retreat and he hurries on. A bolder
          shaman will sometimes ask the ghosts for the soul, and if they
          refuse to give it, he will wrest it from them. They attack him, but
          he clubs them and brings away the soul by force. When he comes back
          to the world, he takes off his mask and shews his club all bloody.
          Then the people know he had a desperate struggle. If he foresees
          that the harrowing of hell is likely to prove a tough job, he
          increases the number of wooden pins in his mask. The rescued soul
          is placed by him on the patient's head and so returned to his
          body.<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href=

          the Twana Indians of Washington State the descent of the

          represented in pantomime before the eyes of the spectators, who
          include women and children as well as men. The surface of the
          ground is often broken to facilitate the descent of the rescue
          party. When the adventurous band is supposed to have reached the
          bottom, they journey along, cross at least one stream, and travel
          till they come to the abode of the spirits. These they surprise,
          and after a desperate struggle, sustained with great ardour and a
          prodigious noise, they succeed in rescuing the poor souls, and so,
          wrapping them up in cloth, they make the best of their way back to
          the upper world and restore the recovered souls to their owners,

          the modes of recovering them are various. If a man suffers from a
          colic, the sorcerer may say that in planting sugar-cane, maize or
          what-not, he has pierced the stomach of a certain god who lives
          like a mole in the ground, and that the injured deity has punished
          him by abstracting his soul and burying it under a plant. Hence the
          cure for the colic is to pull up the plant and water the hole with
          millet wine and the blood of a fowl, a goat, or a pig. Again, if a
          child falls ill in the forest or the fields, it is because some
          devil has made off with its soul. To retrieve this spiritual loss
          the sorcerer constructs an apparatus which comprises an egg-shell
          in an egg-holder, a little waxen image of the sick child, and a
          small bamboo full of millet wine. This apparatus he sets up at a
          cross-road, praying the devil to drink the wine and surrender the
          stolen soul by depositing it in the egg-shell. Then he returns to
          the house, and putting a little cotton to the child's head restores
          the soul to its owner. Sometimes the sorcerer lays a trap for the
          thievish demon, the bait consisting of the liver of a pig or a fowl
          and the blood-smeared handle of a little mattock. At nightfall he
          sets the trap at a cross-road and lies in wait hard by. While the
          devil is licking the blood and munching the liver, the artful
          sorcerer pounces out on him, and after a severe struggle wrests the
          soul from his clutches, returning to the village victorious, but
          breathless and bleeding from his terrific encounter with the enemy
          of souls.<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href=

          and convulsions are generally set down by the Chinese to the agency
          of certain mischievous spirits who love to draw men's souls out of
          their bodies. At Amoy the spirits who serve babies and children in
          this way rejoice in the high-sounding titles of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“celestial agencies bestriding galloping horses”</span>
          and <span class="tei tei-q">“literary graduates residing halfway up
          in the sky.”</span> When an infant is writhing in convulsions, the
          frightened mother hastens to the roof of the house, and, waving
          about a bamboo pole to which one of the child's garments is
          attached, cries out several times, <span class="tei tei-q">“My
          child So-and-so, come back, return home!”</span> Meantime, another
          inmate of the house bangs away at a gong in the <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hope of attracting the attention of the
          strayed soul, which is supposed to recognise the familiar garment
          and to slip into it. The garment containing the soul is then placed
          on or beside the child, and if the child does not die recovery is
          sure to follow sooner or later.<a id="noteref_195" name=

          Papuans of Geelvink Bay in New Guinea are apt to think that the
          mists which sometimes hang about the tops of tall trees in their
          tropical forests envelop a spirit or god called Narbrooi, who draws
          away the breath or soul of those whom he loves, thus causing them
          to languish and die. Accordingly, when a man lies sick, a friend or
          relation will go to one of these mist-capped trees and endeavour to
          recover the lost soul. At the foot of the tree he makes a peculiar
          sound to attract the attention of the spirit, and lights a cigar.
          In its curling smoke his fancy discerns the fair and youthful form
          of Narbrooi himself, who, decked with flowers, appears and informs
          the anxious enquirer whether the soul of his sick friend is with
          him or not. If it is, the man asks, <span class="tei tei-q">“Has he
          done any wrong?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh no!”</span> the
          spirit answers, <span class="tei tei-q">“I love him, and therefore
          I have taken him to myself.”</span> So the man lays down an
          offering at the foot of the tree, and goes home with the soul of
          the sufferer in a straw bag. Arrived at the house, he empties the
          bag with its precious contents <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          hands with ginger-root, which he had first chewed small, and then
          ties a bandage round one of the patient's wrists. If the bandage
          bursts, it is a sign that Narbrooi has repented of his bargain, and
          is drawing away the sufferer once more to himself.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Moluccas
          when a man is unwell it is thought that some devil has carried away
          his soul to the tree, mountain, or hill where he (the devil)
          resides. A sorcerer having pointed out the devil's abode, the
          friends of the patient carry thither cooked rice, fruit, fish, raw
          eggs, a hen, a chicken, a silken robe, gold, armlets, and so forth.
          Having set out the food in order they pray, saying: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We come to offer to you, O devil, this offering of
          food, clothes, gold, and so on; take it and release the soul of the
          patient for whom we pray. Let it return to his body, and he who now
          is sick shall be made whole.”</span> Then they eat a little and let
          the hen loose as a ransom for the soul of the patient; also they
          put down the raw eggs; but the silken robe, the gold, and the
          armlets they take home with them. As soon as they are come to the
          house they place a flat bowl containing the offerings which have
          been brought back at the sick man's head, and say to him:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Now is your soul released, and you shall
          fare well and live to grey hairs on the earth.”</span><a id=

          more modern account from the same region describes how the friend
          of the patient, after depositing his offerings on the spot where
          the missing soul is supposed to be, calls out thrice the name of
          the sick person, adding, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come with me,
          come with me.”</span> Then he returns, making a motion with a cloth
          as if he had caught the soul in it. He must not look to right or
          left or speak a word to any one he meets, but must go straight to
          the patient's house. At the door he stands, and calling out the
          sick person's name, asks whether he is returned. Being <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> answered from within that he is
          returned, he enters and lays the cloth in which he has caught the
          soul on the patient's throat, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now
          you are returned to the house.”</span> Sometimes a substitute is
          provided; a doll, dressed up in gay clothing and tinsel, is offered
          to the demon in exchange for the patient's soul, with these words,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Give us back the ugly one which you have
          taken away and receive this pretty one instead.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Alfoors or Toradjas of Poso, in Central Celebes, a wooden puppet is
          offered to the demon as a substitute for the soul which he has
          abstracted, and the patient must touch the puppet in order to
          identify himself with it. The effigy is then hung on a bamboo pole,
          which is planted at the place of sacrifice outside of the house.
          Here too are deposited offerings of rice, an egg, a little wood
          (which is afterwards kindled), a sherd of a broken cooking-pot, and
          so forth. A long rattan extends from the place of sacrifice to the
          sufferer, who grasps one end of it firmly, for along it his lost
          soul will return when the devil has kindly released it. All being
          ready, the priestess informs the demon that he has come to the
          wrong place, and that there are no doubt much better quarters where
          he could reside. Then the father of the patient, standing beside
          the offerings, takes up his parable as follows: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O demon, we forgot to sacrifice to you. You have
          visited us with this sickness; will you now go away from us to some
          other place? We have made ready provisions for you on the journey.
          See, here is a cooking-pot, here are rice, fire, and a fowl. O
          demon, go away from us.”</span> With that the priestess strews rice
          towards the bamboo-pole to lure back the wandering soul; and the
          fowl promised to the devil is thrown in the same direction, but is
          instantly jerked back again by a string which, in a spirit of
          intelligent economy, has been previously attached to its leg. The
          demon is now supposed to accept the puppet, which hangs from the
          pole, and to release the soul, which, sliding down the pole and
          along the rattan, returns to its proper owner. And lest the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name=
          "Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> evil spirit should
          repent of the barter which has just been effected, all
          communication with him is broken off by cutting down the

          Similarly the Mongols make up a horse of birch-bark and a doll, and
          invite the demon to take the doll instead of the patient and to
          ride away on the horse.<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href=

          Yakut shaman, rigged out in his professional costume, with his drum
          in his hand, will boldly descend into the lower world and haggle
          with the demon who has carried off a sick man's soul. Not
          uncommonly the demon proves amenable to reason, and in
          consideration of the narrow circumstances of the patient's family
          will accept a more moderate ransom than he at first demanded. For
          instance, he may be brought to put up with the skin of an Arctic
          hare or Arctic fox instead of a foal or a steer. The bargain being
          struck, the shaman hurries back to the sufferer's bedside, from
          which to the merely carnal eye he has never stirred, and informs
          the anxious relatives of the success of his mission. They in turn
          gladly hasten to provide the ransom.<a id="noteref_204" name=

          the priest performs a ceremony for the purpose of restoring their
          souls to the inmates. He hangs up a bag at the place of sacrifice
          and then goes through a list of the gods. There are so many of them
          that this takes him the whole night through without stopping. In

          this world of shadows to his own bright world of radiant light, and
          a ceremony must needs be performed to win back these passing souls
          to earth. Accordingly, while it is still night, the priest begins
          to drum and pray, and he continues his orisons till about nine
          o'clock next morning. Then he takes his stand at an opening in the
          roof through which he can behold the sun, and spreading out a cloth
          waits till the beams of the morning sun fall full upon it. In the
          sunbeams he thinks the wandering souls have come back again; so he
          wraps the cloth up tightly, and quitting the opening in the roof,

          lay very sick, saw a company of gods from the mountain sitting in
          the doorway. They were handing from one to another the soul of the
          dying chief. It was wrapt in a leaf, and had been passed from the
          gods inside the house to those sitting in the doorway. One of the
          gods handed the soul to one of the wizards, taking him for a god in
          the dark, for it was night. Then all the gods rose up and went
          away; but the wizard kept the chief's soul. In the morning some
          women went with a present of fine mats to fetch a famous physician.
          The wizards were sitting on the shore as the women passed, and they
          said to the women, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give us the mats and we

          very ill, his jaw hung down, and his end seemed near. But the
          wizards undid the leaf and let the soul into him again, and

          Salish or Flathead Indians of Oregon believe that a man's soul may
          be separated for a time from his body without causing death and
          without the man being aware of his loss. It is necessary, however,
          that the lost soul should be soon found and restored to its owner
          or he will die. The name of the man who has lost his soul is
          revealed in a dream to the medicine-man, who hastens to inform the
          sufferer of his loss. Generally a number of men have sustained a
          like loss at the same time; all their names are revealed to the
          medicine-man, and all employ him to recover their souls. The whole
          night long these soulless men go about the village from lodge to
          lodge, dancing and singing. Towards daybreak they go into a
          separate lodge, which is closed up so as to be totally dark. A
          small hole is then made in the roof, through which the
          medicine-man, with a bunch of feathers, brushes in the souls, in
          the shape of bits of bone and the like, which he receives on a
          piece of matting. A fire is next kindled, by the light of which the
          medicine-man sorts out the souls. First he puts aside the souls of
          dead people, of which there are usually several; for if he were to
          give the soul of a dead person to a living man, the man would die
          instantly. Next he picks out the souls of all the persons present,
          and making them all to sit down before him, he takes the soul of
          each, in the shape of a splinter of bone, wood, or shell, and
          placing it on the owner's head, pats it with many prayers and

          Offerings of food are therefore left under a tree and the soul is

          Amongst the Dyaks of Sarawak the priest conjures the lost soul into
          a cup, where it is seen by the uninitiated as a lock of hair, but

          Amongst the Indians of Santiago Tepehuacan, if a child has fallen
          from the arms of its bearer and an illness has resulted from the
          fall, the parents will take the child's shirt, stretch it out on
          the spot where the little one fell, and say, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come, come, come back to the infant.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name=
          "Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Then they bring back
          a little of the earth wrapped up in the shirt, and put the shirt on
          the child. They say that in this manner the spirit is replaced in
          the child's body and that he will recover.<a id="noteref_220" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a> With
          this we may compare an Irish custom reported by Camden. When any
          one happens to fall, he springs up again, and turning round thrice
          to the right, digs the earth with a sword or knife, and takes up a
          turf, because they say the earth restores his shade to him. But if
          he falls sick within two or three days thereafter, a woman skilled
          in these matters is sent to the spot, and there says: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I call thee, So-and-so, from the East and West, from
          the South and North, from the groves, woods, rivers, marshes,
          fairies white, red, and black,”</span> and so forth. After uttering
          certain short prayers, she returns home to the sick person, and
          whispering in his ear another prayer, along with a <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pater Noster</span></span>, puts some burning
          coals into a cup of clean water, and so decides whether the
          distemper has been inflicted by the fairies.<a id="noteref_221"

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a> Here,
          though Camden is not very explicit, and he probably did not quite
          understand the custom he describes, it seems plain that the shade
          or soul of a man who has fallen is conceived as adhering to the
          ground where he fell. Accordingly he seeks to regain possession of
          it by digging up the earth; but if he fails to recover it, he sends
          a wise woman to the spot to win back his soul from the fairies who
          are detaining it.</p>

          horned beast, such as an ox or a gazelle. So the priests went in
          quest of the missing spirit, slaughtered the animal which had
          devoured it, and cutting open the carcase found the soul still

          were made of stout cinet, about fifteen to thirty feet long, with
          loops on either side of different sizes, to suit the different
          sizes of souls; for fat souls there were large loops, for thin
          souls there were small ones. When a man was sick against whom the
          sorcerers had a grudge, they set up these soul-snares near his
          house and watched for the flight of his soul. If in the shape of a

          priest obligingly caught the spirit of the god in a snare made of
          coco-nut fibre, and then infused it into the woman. When the child
          was born, the mother took it to the temple and dedicated it to the

          some parts of West Africa, indeed, wizards are continually setting
          traps to catch souls that wander from their bodies in sleep; and
          when they have caught one, they tie it up over the fire, and as it
          shrivels in the heat the owner sickens. This is done, not out of
          any grudge towards the sufferer, but purely as a matter of
          business. The wizard does not care whose soul he has captured, and
          will readily restore it to its owner if only he is paid for doing
          so. Some sorcerers keep regular asylums for strayed souls, and
          anybody <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg

          who has lost or mislaid his own soul can always have another one
          from the asylum on payment of the usual fee. No blame whatever
          attaches to men who keep these private asylums or set traps for
          passing souls; it is their profession, and in the exercise of it
          they are actuated by no harsh or unkindly feelings. But there are
          also wretches who from pure spite or for the sake of lucre set and
          bait traps with the deliberate purpose of catching the soul of a
          particular man; and in the bottom of the pot, hidden by the bait,
          are knives and sharp hooks which tear and rend the poor soul,
          either killing it outright or mauling it so as to impair the health
          of its owner when it succeeds in escaping and returning to him.
          Miss Kingsley knew a Kruman who became very anxious about his soul,

          smell of smoked crawfish seasoned with red pepper. Clearly some
          ill-wisher had set a trap baited with this dainty for his
          dream-soul, intending to do him grievous bodily, or rather
          spiritual, harm; and for the next few nights great pains were taken
          to keep his soul from straying abroad in his sleep. In the
          sweltering heat of the tropical night he lay sweating and snorting
          under a blanket, his nose and mouth tied up with a handkerchief to
          prevent the escape of his precious soul.<a id="noteref_230" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Dyaks of
          the Upper Melawie are about to go out head-hunting they take the
          precaution of securing the souls of their enemies before they
          attempt to kill their bodies, calculating apparently that mere
          bodily death will soon follow the spiritual death, or capture, of
          the soul. With this intention they clear a small space in the
          underwood of the forest, and set up in the clearing one of those
          miniature houses in which it is customary to deposit the ashes of
          the dead. Food is placed in the little house, which, though raised
          on four posts, is connected with the ground by a tiny inverted
          ladder of the sort up which spirits are believed to swarm. When
          these preparations have been completed, the leader of the
          expedition comes and sits down a little way from the miniature
          house, and addressing the spirits of kinsmen who had the misfortune
          to be beheaded by their enemies, he says, <span class=

          friends and acquaintances of the ghosts he means the souls of the
          enemies against whom he is about to lead the expedition. Meantime
          the other warriors have hidden themselves close by behind trees and
          bushes, and are listening with all their ears. When the cry of an
          animal is heard in the forest, or a humming sound seems to issue
          from the little house, it is a sign that the ghosts of their
          friends have come, bringing with them the souls of their enemies,
          which are accordingly at their mercy. At that the lurking warriors
          leap forth from their ambush, and with brandished blades hew and
          slash at the souls of their foemen swarming unseen in the air.
          Taken completely by surprise, the panic-stricken souls flee in all
          directions, and are fain to hide under every leaf and stone on the
          ground. But even here their retreat is cut off. For now the leader
          of the expedition is hard at work, grubbing up with his hands every
          stone and leaf to right and left, and thrusting them with feverish
          haste into the basket, which he at once ties up securely. He now
          flatters himself that he has the souls of the enemy safe in his
          possession; and when in the course of the expedition the heads of
          the foe are severed from their bodies, he will pack them into the

          Karen wizard will catch the wandering soul of a sleeper and
          transfer it to the body of a dead man. The latter, therefore, comes
          to life as the former dies. But the friends of the sleeper in turn
          engage a wizard to steal the soul of another sleeper, who dies as
          the first sleeper comes to life. In this way an indefinite
          succession of deaths and resurrections is supposed to take
          place.<a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nowhere perhaps
          is the art of abducting human souls more carefully cultivated or
          carried to higher perfection than in the Malay Peninsula. Here the
          methods by which the wizard works his will are various, and so too
          are his motives. Sometimes he desires to destroy an enemy,
          sometimes to win the love of a cold or bashful beauty. Some of the
          charms operate entirely without contact; in others, the receptacle
          into which the soul is to be lured has formed part of, or at least
          touched, the person of the victim. Thus, to take an <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> instance of the latter sort of charm,
          the following are the directions given for securing the soul of one
          whom you wish to render distraught. Take soil from the middle of
          his footprint; wrap it up in pieces of red, black, and yellow
          cloth, taking care to keep the yellow outside; and hang it from the
          centre of your mosquito curtain with parti-coloured thread. It will
          then become your victim's soul. To complete the transubstantiation,
          however, it is needful to switch the packet with a birch composed
          of seven leaf-ribs from a <span class="tei tei-q">“green”</span>
          coco-nut. Do this seven times at sunset, at midnight, and at
          sunrise, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not earth that I
          switch, but the heart of So-and-so.”</span> Then bury it in the
          middle of a path where your victim is sure to step over it, and he
          will unquestionably become distraught.<a id="noteref_236" name=
          "noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a>
          Another way is to scrape the wood of the floor where your intended
          victim has been sitting, mix the scrapings with earth from his or
          her footprint, and knead the whole with wax from a deserted bees'
          comb into a likeness of him or her. Then fumigate the figure with
          incense and beckon to the soul every night for three nights
          successively by waving a cloth, while you recite the appropriate
          spell.<a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href=
          "#note_237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a> In
          the following cases the charm takes effect without any contact
          whatever, whether direct or indirect, with the victim. When the
          moon, just risen, looks red above the eastern horizon, go out, and
          standing in the moonlight, with the big toe of your right foot on
          the big toe of your left, make a speaking-trumpet of your right
          hand and recite through it the following words:</p>

          occasion at Athens. On the eve of the sailing of the fleet for
          Syracuse, when all hearts beat high with hope, and visions of
          empire dazzled all eyes, consternation suddenly fell on the people
          one May morning when they rose and found that most of the images of
          Hermes in the city had been mysteriously mutilated in the night.
          The impious perpetrators of the sacrilege were unknown, but whoever
          they were, the priests and priestesses solemnly cursed them
          according to the ancient ritual, standing with their faces to the

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Indians of
          the Nass River, in British Columbia, are impressed with a belief
          that a physician may swallow his patient's soul by mistake. A
          doctor who is believed to have done so is made by the other members
          of the faculty to stand over the patient, while one of them thrusts
          his fingers down the doctor's throat, another kneads him in the
          stomach with his knuckles, and a third slaps him on the back. If
          the soul is not in him after all, and if the same process has been
          repeated upon all the medical men without success, it is concluded
          that the soul must be in the head-doctor's box. A party of doctors,
          therefore, waits upon him at his house and requests him to produce
          his box. When he has done so and arranged its contents on a new
          mat, they take the votary of Aesculapius and hold him up by the
          heels with his head in a hole in the floor. In this position they
          wash his head, and <span class="tei tei-q">“any water remaining
          from the ablution is taken and poured upon the sick man's
          head.”</span><a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href=

          the Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia it is forbidden to pass
          behind the back of a shaman while he is eating, lest the shaman
          should inadvertently swallow the soul of the passer-by. When that
          happens, both the shaman and the person whose soul he has swallowed
          fall down in a swoon. Blood flows from the shaman's mouth, because
          the soul is too large for him and is tearing his inside. Then the
          clan of the person whose soul is doing this mischief must assemble
          and sing the song of the shaman. In time the suffering sorcerer
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name=
          "Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> vomits out the soul,
          which he exhibits in the shape of a small bloody ball in the open
          palms of his hands. He restores it to its owner, who is lying
          prostrate on a mat, by throwing it at him and then blowing on his
          head. The man whose soul was swallowed has very naturally to pay
          for the damage he did to the shaman as well as for his own
          cure.<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href=

          they thought their chance had come, and sent a girl to see how he
          was. She took a small horn, used for cupping blood, in her hand,
          and while she talked with him she placed the cupping-horn on his
          shadow. To her surprise it drew blood. So she returned and told her
          friends that, if they wished to kill Apodtho, they must not touch
          his body, but spear his shadow. They did so, and he died and turned

          consciousness at once and will die if the proper antidote be not

          Clearly in these cases the shadow, if not equivalent to the soul,
          is at least regarded as a living part of the man or the animal, so
          that injury done to the shadow is felt by the person or animal as
          if it were done to his body. Even the shadows of trees are supposed
          by the Caffres to be sensitive. Hence when a Caffre doctor seeks to
          pluck the leaves of a tree for medicinal purposes, he <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“takes care to run up quickly, and to avoid touching
          the shadow lest it should inform the tree of the danger, and so
          give the tree time to withdraw the medicinal properties from its

          would be to come into contact with the person or animal. Thus in

          of the goat-sucker bird falls on an ox or a cow, but especially on
          a cow buffalo, the beast will soon die. The remedy is for some one
          to kill the bird, rub his hands or a stick in the blood, and then
          wave the stick over the animal. There are certain men who are noted

          is regarded as so intimately bound up with the life of the man that
          its loss entails debility or death, it is natural to expect that
          its diminution should be regarded with solicitude and apprehension,
          as betokening a corresponding decrease in the vital energy of its
          owner. An elegant Greek rhetorician has compared the man who lives
          only for fame to one who should set all his heart on his shadow,
          puffed up and boastful when it lengthened, sad and dejected when it
          shortened, wasting and pining away when it dwindled to nothing. The
          spirits of such an one, he goes on, would necessarily be volatile,
          since they must rise or fall with every passing hour of the day. In
          the morning, when the level sun, just risen above the eastern
          horizon, stretched out his shadow to enormous length, rivalling the
          shadows cast by the cypresses and the towers on the city wall, how
          blithe and exultant would he be, fancying that in stature he had
          become a match for the fabled giants of old; with what a lofty port
          he would then strut and shew himself in the streets and the
          market-place and wherever men congregated, that he might be seen
          and admired of all. But as the day wore on, his countenance would
          change and he would slink back crestfallen to his house. At noon,
          when his once towering shadow had shrunk to his feet, he would shut
          himself up and refuse to stir abroad, ashamed to look <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his fellow-townsmen in the face; but in

          rhetorician who thus sought to expose the vanity of fame as an
          object of human ambition by likening it to an ever-changing shadow,
          little dreamed that in real life there were men who set almost as
          much store by their shadows as the fool whom he had conjured up in
          his imagination to point a moral. So hard is it for the straining
          wings of fancy to outstrip the folly of mankind. In Amboyna and
          Uliase, two islands near the equator, where necessarily there is
          little or no shadow cast at noon, the people make it a rule not to
          go out of the house at mid-day, because they fancy that by doing so
          a man may lose the shadow of his soul.<a id="noteref_291" name=

          shortened towards noon his strength ebbed with it, till exactly at
          noon it reached its lowest point; then, as the shadow stretched out
          in the afternoon, his strength returned. A certain hero discovered

          Baganda of central Africa used to judge of a man's health by the

          Similarly the Caffres of South Africa think that a man's shadow
          grows very small or vanishes at death. When her husband is away at
          the wars, a woman hangs up his sleeping-mat; if the shadow grows
          less, she says her husband is killed; if it remains unchanged, she
          says he is unscathed.<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href=

          even in lands outside the tropics the observation of the diminished
          shadow at noon may have contributed, even if it did not give rise,
          to the superstitious dread with which that hour has been viewed by

          perhaps, does the equivalence of the shadow to the life or soul
          come out more clearly than in some customs practised to this day in
          south-eastern Europe. In modern Greece, when the foundation of a
          new building is being laid, it is the custom to kill a cock, a ram,
          or a lamb, and to let its blood flow on the foundation-stone, under
          which the animal is afterwards buried. The object of the sacrifice
          is to give strength and stability to the building. But sometimes,
          instead of killing an animal, the builder entices a man to the
          foundation-stone, secretly measures his body, or a part of it, or
          his shadow, and buries the measure under the foundation-stone; or
          he lays the foundation-stone upon the man's shadow. It is believed
          that the man will die within the year.<a id="noteref_302" name=

          the island of Lesbos it is deemed enough if the builder merely
          casts a stone at the shadow of a passer-by; the man whose shadow is
          thus struck will die, but the building will be solid.<a id=

          Bulgarian mason measures the shadow of a man with a string, places
          the string in a box, and then builds the box into the wall of the
          edifice. Within forty days thereafter the man whose shadow was
          measured will be dead and his soul will be in the box beside the
          string; but often it will come forth and appear in its former shape
          to persons who were born on a Saturday. If a Bulgarian builder
          cannot obtain a human shadow for this purpose, he will content
          himself with measuring the shadow of the first animal that comes
          that way.<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href=

          Roumanians of Transylvania think that he whose shadow is thus
          immured will die within forty days; so persons passing by a
          building which is in course of erection may hear a warning cry,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Beware lest they take thy shadow!”</span>
          Not long ago there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg

          were still shadow-traders whose business it was to provide
          architects with the shadows necessary for securing their
          walls.<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a> In
          these cases the measure of the shadow is looked on as equivalent to
          the shadow itself, and to bury it is to bury the life or soul of
          the man, who, deprived of it, must die. Thus the custom is a
          substitute for the old practice of immuring a living person in the
          walls, or crushing him under the foundation-stone of a new
          building, in order to give strength and durability to the
          structure, or more definitely in order that the angry ghost may
          haunt the place and guard it against the intrusion of enemies. Thus
          when a new gate was made or an old gate was repaired in the walls
          of Bangkok, it used to be customary to crush three men to death
          under an enormous beam in a pit at the gateway. Before they were
          led to their doom, they were regaled at a splendid banquet; the
          whole court came to salute them; and the king himself charged them
          straitly to guard well the gate that was to be committed to their
          care, and to warn him if enemies or rebels came to assault the
          city. The next moment the ropes were cut and the beam descended on
          them. The Siamese believed that these unfortunates were transformed
          into the genii which they called <span class=

          said that when the massive teak posts of the gateways of Mandalay
          were set up, a man was bound and placed under each post and crushed
          to death. The Burmese believe that men who die a violent death turn
          into <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nats</span></span> or demons and haunt the
          spot where they were killed, doing a mischief to such as attempt to
          molest the place. Thus their spirits become guardians of the
          gates.<a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href=

          theory would explain why such sacrifices appear to be offered most
          commonly at thoroughfares, such as gates and bridges, where ghostly
          warders may be deemed especially serviceable in keeping; watch on
          the multitudes that go to and fro.<a id="noteref_308" name=

          district of the East Indian island of Sambawa, the custom is marked
          by some peculiar features, which deserve to be mentioned. When a
          new flag-pole is set up at the sultan's palace a woman is crushed
          to death under it; but she must be pregnant. If the destined victim
          should be brought to bed before her execution, she goes free. The
          notion may be that the ghost of such a woman would be more than
          usually fierce and vigilant. Again, when the wooden doors are set
          up at the palace, it is customary to bury a child under each of the
          door-posts. For these purposes officers are sent to scour the
          country for a pregnant woman or little children, as the case may
          be, and if they come back empty-handed they must give up their own
          wives or children to serve as victims. When the gates are set up,
          the children are killed, their bodies stript of flesh, and their
          bones laid in the holes in which the door-posts are erected. Then
          the flesh is boiled with horse's flesh and served up to the
          officers. Any officer who refuses to eat of it is at once cut
          down.<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href=
          "#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a> The
          intention of this last practice is perhaps to secure the fidelity
          of the officers by compelling them to enter into a covenant of the
          most solemn and binding nature with the ghosts of the murdered
          children who are to guard the gates.</p>

          nothing more or less than the measuring-tape which was used to
          measure the foundations of the house or of the village temple.
          After it has served this useful purpose, the tape is wound about a
          stick shaped like a paddle, and is then deposited in the thatch of
          the roof of the house, where food is offered to it on all special
          occasions. The deified measuring-tape of the whole village is that
          which was used to measure the foundations of the first house or of
          the village temple. The handle of the paddle-like stick on which it
          is wound is carved into the figure of a person squatting in the
          usual posture; and the whole is kept in a rough wooden box along

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further, we can
          now explain the widespread custom of covering up mirrors or turning
          them to the wall after a death has taken place in the house. It is
          feared that the soul, projected out of the person in the shape of
          his reflection in the mirror, may be carried off by the ghost of
          the departed, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg

          which is commonly supposed to linger about the house till the
          burial. The custom is thus exactly parallel to the Aru custom of
          not sleeping in a house after a death for fear that the soul,
          projected out of the body in a dream, may meet the ghost and be
          carried off by it.<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href=

          Oldenburg it is thought that if a person sees his image in a mirror
          after a death he will die himself. So all the mirrors in the house
          are covered up with white cloth.<a id="noteref_323" name=

          doubtless because they might reflect a person's image. The same
          custom of covering up mirrors or turning them to the wall after a
          death prevails in England, Scotland, Madagascar,<a id="noteref_325"

          also plain; in time of sickness, when the soul might take flight so
          easily, it is particularly dangerous to project it out of the body
          by means of the reflection in a mirror. The rule is therefore
          precisely parallel to the rule observed by some peoples of not
          allowing sick people to sleep;<a id="noteref_329" name=

          in sleep the soul is projected out of the body, <span class=

          perhaps on account of the mirror's supposed power of drawing out
          the soul in the reflection and so facilitating its capture.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As with shadows
          and reflections, so with portraits; they are often believed to
          contain the soul of the person portrayed. People who hold this

          the portrait is the soul, or at least a vital part of the person
          portrayed, whoever possesses the portrait will be able to exercise
          a fatal influence over the original of it. Thus the Esquimaux of

          River an explorer had set up his camera to get a picture of the
          people as they were moving about among their houses. While he was
          focusing the instrument, the headman of the village came up and
          insisted on peeping under the cloth. Being allowed to do so, he
          gazed intently for a minute at the moving figures on the ground
          glass, then suddenly withdrew his head and bawled at the top of his
          voice to the people, <span class="tei tei-q">“He has all of your
          shades in this box.”</span> A panic ensued among the group, and in

          executed. They believed that by photographing people the artist

          The camera was at first an object of dread to them, and when it was

          photographed on condition that the picture should be shewn to none
          of his subjects, but sent out of the country as soon as possible.
          He feared lest some ill-wisher might use it to bewitch him. Some

          the west coast of Madagascar, the people suddenly became hostile.
          The day before the travellers, not without difficulty, had
          photographed the royal family, and now found themselves accused of
          taking the souls of the natives for the purpose of selling them

          Europeans who travel into the jungle have, even at the present

          away from him, a portion of his life goes with the picture. Unless

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for the
          primitive conceptions of the soul and the dangers to which it is
          exposed. These conceptions are not limited to one people or
          country; with variations of detail they are found all over the
          world, and survive, as we have seen, in modern Europe. Beliefs so
          deep-seated and so widespread must necessarily have contributed to
          shape the mould in which the early kingship was cast. For if every
          person was at such pains to save his own soul from the perils which
          threatened it on so many sides, how much more carefully must
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">he</span></em> have been guarded upon whose
          life hung the welfare and even the existence of the whole people,
          and whom therefore it was the common interest of all to preserve?
          Therefore we should expect to find the king's life protected by a
          system of precautions or safeguards still more numerous and minute
          than those which in primitive society every man adopts for the
          safety of his own soul. Now in point of fact the life of the early
          kings is regulated, as we have seen and shall see more fully
          presently, by a very exact code of rules. May we not then
          conjecture that these rules are in fact the very safeguards which
          we should expect to find adopted for the protection of the king's
          life? An examination of the rules themselves confirms this
          conjecture. For from this it appears that some of the rules
          observed by the kings are identical with those observed by private
          persons out of regard for the safety of their souls; and even of
          those which seem peculiar to the king, many, if not all, are most
          readily <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg

          explained on the hypothesis that they are nothing but safeguards or
          lifeguards of the king. I will now enumerate some of these royal
          rules or taboos, offering on each of them such comments and
          explanations as may serve to set the original intention of the rule
          in its proper light.</p>

              <span style="font-size: 80%">The general effect of these rules
              is to isolate the king, especially from strangers. The savage
              fears the magic arts of strangers and hence guards himself
              against them. Various modes of disenchanting strangers.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the object of
          the royal taboos is to isolate the king from all sources of danger,
          their general effect is to compel him to live in a state of
          seclusion, more or less complete, according to the number and
          stringency of the rules he observes. Now of all sources of danger
          none are more dreaded by the savage than magic and witchcraft, and
          he suspects all strangers of practising these black arts. To guard
          against the baneful influence exerted voluntarily or involuntarily
          by strangers is therefore an elementary dictate of savage prudence.
          Hence before strangers are allowed to enter a district, or at least
          before they are permitted to mingle freely with the inhabitants,
          certain ceremonies are often performed by the natives of the
          country for the purpose of disarming the strangers of their magical
          powers, of counteracting the baneful influence which is believed to
          emanate from them, or of disinfecting, so to speak, the tainted
          atmosphere by which they are supposed to be surrounded. Thus, when
          the ambassadors sent by Justin II., Emperor of the East, to
          conclude a peace with the Turks had reached their destination, they
          were received by shamans, who subjected them to a ceremonial
          purification for the purpose of exorcising all harmful influence.
          Having deposited the goods brought by the ambassadors in an open
          place, these wizards carried burning branches of incense round
          them, while they rang a bell and beat on a tambourine, snorting and
          falling into a state of frenzy in their efforts to dispel the
          powers of evil. Afterwards they purified the ambassadors themselves
          by leading them through the flames.<a id="noteref_355" name=

          would avert any disease or treachery which these strangers might
          have brought with them. Meat offerings were also laid upon the
          altars, accompanied by songs and dances in honour of the god. While

          Two young men danced, and one of them in dancing sprinkled water

          stranger, who holds it in his hands for a while and then gives it
          back to him. This is thought to protect the children from the evil

          over the captain's head. Then <span class="tei tei-q">“he placed
          the leaves in my left hand, putting a small green twig into his

          travelling in South America he entered a village of the Apalai
          Indians. A few moments after his arrival some of the Indians
          brought him a number of large black ants, of a species whose bite
          is painful, fastened on palm leaves. Then all the people of the
          village, without distinction of age or sex, presented themselves to
          him, and he had to sting them all with the ants on their faces,
          thighs, and other parts of their bodies. Sometimes when he applied
          the ants too tenderly they called out <span class=

          the wounds, believing that she will thereby hurt the evil spirit
          and force him to be gone. The poor child naturally screams with

          sorceresses in south-eastern Borneo will sometimes slash the body

          perhaps the notion rather is to make the present quarters of the
          spirit too hot for him. With a similar intention some of the
          natives of Borneo and Celebes sprinkle rice upon the head or body
          of a person supposed to be infested by dangerous spirits; a fowl is
          then brought, which, by picking up the rice from the person's head
          or body, removes along with it the spirit or ghost which is
          clinging like a burr to his skin. This is done, for example, to
          persons who have attended a funeral, and who may therefore be
          supposed to be infested by the ghost <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Similarly Basutos, who have carried a corpse to the grave, have
          their hands scratched with a knife from the tip of the thumb to the
          tip of the forefinger, and magic stuff is rubbed into the
          wound,<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href=

          the purpose, no doubt, of removing the ghost which may be adhering
          to their skin. Among the Barotse of south-eastern Africa a few days
          after a funeral the sorcerer makes an incision in the forehead of
          each surviving member of the family and fills it with medicine,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“in order to ward off contagion and the

          counteracting any evil influence that may emanate from the dead
          elephant, and of acquiring thereby the fleetness of foot possessed

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
          that the same dread of strangers, rather than any desire to do them
          honour, is the motive of certain ceremonies which are sometimes
          observed at their reception, but of which the intention is not
          directly stated. In the Ongtong Java Islands, which are inhabited
          by Polynesians, and lie a little to the north of the Solomon
          Islands, the priests or sorcerers seem to wield great influence.
          Their main business is to summon or exorcise spirits for the
          purpose of averting or dispelling sickness, and of procuring
          favourable winds, a good catch of fish, and so on. When strangers
          land on the islands, they are first of all received by the
          sorcerers, sprinkled with water, anointed with oil, and girt
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name=
          "Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with dried pandanus
          leaves. At the same time sand and water are freely thrown about in
          all directions, and the newcomer and his boat are wiped with green
          leaves. After this ceremony the strangers are introduced by the
          sorcerers to the chief.<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href=

          Afghanistan and in some parts of Persia the traveller, before he
          enters a village, is frequently received with a sacrifice of animal
          life or food, or of fire and incense. The Afghan Boundary Mission,
          in passing by villages in Afghanistan, was often met with fire and

          Sometimes a tray of lighted embers is thrown under the hoofs of the

          Before strangers entered the country or city of Benin, custom

          Amongst the Esquimaux of Cumberland Inlet, when a stranger arrives
          at an encampment, the sorcerer goes out to meet him. The stranger
          folds his arms and inclines his head to one side, so as to expose
          his cheek, upon which the magician deals a terrible blow, sometimes
          felling him to the ground. Next the sorcerer in his turn presents
          his cheek to the smiter and receives a buffet from the stranger.
          Then they kiss each other, the ceremony is over, and the stranger
          is hospitably received by all.<a id="noteref_385" name=

          Sometimes the dread of strangers and their magic is too great to
          allow of their reception on any terms. Thus when Speke arrived at a
          certain village, the natives shut their doors against him,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“because they had never before seen a white

          then stepping up to each member of the party, one after another, he
          spat something upon his back and gave him some blows with the
          branch. Lastly, he went into the forest and buried the branch under
          withered leaves in the thickest part of the jungle. This ceremony
          was believed to protect the party against all treachery and danger

          camp, he deputed another to take his place. During his first visit,
          before he became as it were acclimatised, the visitor did nothing
          for himself as to food, drinking-water, or lodging. He was painted
          with a band of white pipe-clay across the face below the eyes, and
          had to learn the Nulit language before going further. He slept on a
          thick layer of leaves so that he should not touch the ground; and
          he was fed with flesh-meat from the point of a burnt stick, which
          he removed with his teeth, not with his lips. His drinking-water
          was drawn from a small hole in the ground by his entertainers, and
          they made it muddy by stirring it with a stick. He might only take
          three mouthfuls at a time, each of which he had to let slowly
          trickle down his throat. If he did otherwise, his throat would
          close up.<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href=

          Kayans and Kenyahs of Borneo think it well to conciliate the spirit
          of the land when they enter a strange country. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The old men, indeed, trusting to the protection
          afforded by omens, are in little need of further aid, but when
          young boys are brought into a new river of importance, the
          hospitality of the local demons is invoked. The Kayans make an
          offering of fowls' eggs, which must not be bought on the spot, but
          are carried from the house, sometimes for distances so long that
          the devotion of the travellers is more apparent than their presents
          to the spirits of the land. Each boy takes an egg and puts it in a
          bamboo split at the end into four, while one of the older men calls
          upon the hills, rocks, trees, and streams to hear him and to
          witness the offering. Careful to disguise the true nature of the
          gift, he speaks of it as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ovē</span></span>, a yam, using a form of
          words fixed by usage. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Omen bird,’</span>
          he shouts into the air, <span class="tei tei-q">‘we have brought
          you these boys. It is on their account only that we have prepared
          this feast. Harm them not; make things go pleasantly; and they give
          you the usual offering of a yam. I give this to the
          country.’</span> The little ceremony is performed behind the hut
          where the night is spent, and the boys wait about for the charm to
          take effect. The custom of the Kenyahs shows the same <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> feeling for the unknown and unseen
          spirits that are supposed to abound. A fowl's feathers, one for
          each boy, are held by an old man, while the youngsters touch his
          arm. The invocation is quite a powerful example of native rhetoric:
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Smooth away trouble, ye mystic mountains,
          hills, valleys, soil, rocks, trees. Shield the lives of the
          children who have come hither.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_392"

          the Toradjas of central Celebes are on a head-hunting expedition
          and have entered the enemy's country, they may not eat any fruits
          which the foe has planted nor any animal which he has reared until
          they have first committed an act of hostility, as by burning a
          house or killing a man. They think that if they broke this rule
          they would receive something of the soul or spiritual essence of
          the enemy into themselves, which would destroy the mystic virtue of
          their talismans.<a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href=

          said that just before Greek armies advanced to the shock of battle,
          a man bearing a lighted torch stepped out from either side and
          threw his torch into the space between the hosts. Then they retired
          unmolested, for they were thought to be sacred to Ares and

          fire thrown out in front of the line of battle may be meant to
          disperse these shadowy combatants, leaving the issue of the fight
          to be determined by more substantial weapons than ghosts can wield.
          Similarly the fire which is sometimes borne at the head of an

          perhaps in some cases intended to dissipate the evil influences,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the opinion
          of savages the acts of eating and drinking are attended with
          special danger; for at these times the soul may escape from the
          mouth, or be extracted by the magic arts of an enemy present. Among
          the Ewe-speaking peoples of the Slave Coast <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the common belief seems to be that the indwelling
          spirit leaves the body and returns to it through the mouth; hence,
          should it have gone out, it behoves a man to be careful about
          opening his mouth, lest a homeless spirit should take advantage of
          the opportunity and enter his body. This, it appears, is considered
          most likely to take place while the man is eating.”</span><a id=

          Precautions are therefore taken to guard against these dangers.
          Thus of the Battas of Sumatra it is said that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“since the soul can leave the body, they always take
          care to prevent their soul from straying on occasions when they
          have most need of it. But it is only possible to prevent the soul
          from straying when one is in the house. At feasts one may find the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If these are the
          ordinary precautions taken by common people, the precautions taken
          by kings are extraordinary. The king of Loango may not be seen
          eating or drinking by man or beast under pain of death. A favourite
          dog having broken into the room where the king was dining, the king
          ordered it to be killed on the spot. Once the king's own son, a boy
          of twelve years old, inadvertently saw the king drink. Immediately
          the king ordered him to be finely apparelled and feasted, after
          which he commanded him to be cut in quarters, and carried about the
          city with a proclamation that he had seen the king drink.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“When the king has a mind to drink, he has
          a cup of wine brought; he that brings it has a bell in his hand,
          and as soon as he has delivered the cup to the king, he turns his
          face from him and rings the bell, on which all present fall down
          with their faces to the ground, and continue so till the king has
          drank.... <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg

          His eating is much in the same style, for which he has a house on
          purpose, where his victuals are set upon a bensa or table: which he
          goes to, and shuts the door: when he has done, he knocks and comes
          out. So that none ever see the king eat or drink. For it is
          believed that if any one should, the king shall immediately
          die.”</span> The remnants of his food are buried, doubtless to
          prevent them from falling into the hands of sorcerers, who by means

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some of the
          preceding cases the intention of eating and drinking in strict
          seclusion may perhaps be to hinder evil influences from entering
          the body rather than to prevent the escape of the soul. This
          certainly is the motive of some drinking customs observed by
          natives of the Congo region. Thus we are told of these people that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“there is hardly a native who would dare to
          swallow a liquid without first conjuring the spirits. One of them
          rings a bell all the time he is drinking; another crouches down and
          places his left hand on the earth; another veils his head; another
          puts a stalk of grass or a leaf in his hair, or marks his forehead
          with a line of clay. This fetish custom assumes very varied forms.
          To explain them, the black is satisfied to say that they are an
          energetic mode of conjuring spirits.”</span> In this part of the
          world a chief will commonly ring a bell at each draught of beer
          which he swallows, and at the same moment a lad stationed in front
          of him brandishes a spear <span class="tei tei-q">“to keep at bay
          the spirits which might try to sneak into the old chief's body by
          the same road as the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          same motive of warding off evil spirits probably explains the
          custom observed by some African sultans of veiling their faces. The
          Sultan of Darfur wraps up his face with a piece of white muslin,
          which goes round his head several times, covering his mouth and
          nose first, and then his forehead, so that only his eyes are
          visible. The same custom of veiling the face as a mark of
          sovereignty is said to be observed in other parts of central
          Africa.<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href=

          they dared not lift their eyes on them, but always turned their
          backs when they had to address them. If a thief, after repeated
          punishments, proved incorrigible, they took him to the chief, and
          one of the nobles, turning the culprit round, said to him,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Since you think yourself so great a lord
          that you have the right to break the laws, you have the right to

          Montezuma was revered by his subjects as a god, and he set so much
          store on their reverence that if on going out of the city he saw a
          man lift up his eyes on him, he had the rash gazer put to death. He
          generally lived in the retirement of his palace, seldom shewing
          himself. On the days when he went to visit his gardens, he was

          king of Jebu, on the Slave Coast of West Africa, is surrounded by a
          great deal of mystery. Until lately his face might not be seen even
          by his own subjects, and if circumstances compelled him to
          communicate with them he did so through a screen which concealed
          him from view. Now, though his face may be seen, it is customary to
          hide his body; and at audiences a cloth is held before him so as to
          conceal him from the neck downwards, and it is raised so as to
          cover him altogether whenever he coughs, sneezes, spits, or takes
          snuff. His face <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg

          Indeed we are told that he may not quit his palace under pain of
          death or of giving up one or more slaves to be executed in his
          presence. As the wealth of the country is measured in slaves, the
          king takes good care not to infringe the law. One day the monarch,
          charmed by some presents which he had received from a French
          officer, politely attended his visitor to the gate, and in a moment
          of forgetfulness was about to break bounds, when his chamberlain,
          seizing his majesty by his legs, and his wives, friends, and
          servants rushing up, prevented him from taking so fatal a step. Yet
          once a year at the Feast of Yams the king is allowed, and even
          required by custom, to dance before his people outside the high mud
          wall of the palace. In dancing he carries a great weight, generally
          a sack of earth, on his back to prove that he is still able to
          support the burden and cares of state. Were he unable to discharge

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, magic
          mischief may be wrought upon a man through the remains of the food
          he has partaken of, or the dishes out of which he has eaten. On the
          principles of sympathetic magic a real connexion continues to
          subsist between the food which a man has in his stomach and the
          refuse of it which he has left untouched, and hence by injuring the
          refuse you can simultaneously injure the eater. Among the
          Narrinyeri of South Australia every adult is constantly on the
          look-out for bones of beasts, birds, or fish, of which the flesh
          has been eaten by somebody, in order to construct a deadly charm
          out of them. Every one is therefore careful to burn the bones of
          the animals which he has eaten lest they should fall into the hands
          of a sorcerer. Too often, however, the sorcerer succeeds in getting
          hold of such a bone, and when he does so he believes that he has
          the power of life and death over the man, woman, or child who ate
          the flesh of the animal. To put the charm in operation he makes a
          paste of red ochre and fish oil, inserts in it the eye of a cod and
          a small piece of the flesh of a corpse, and having rolled the
          compound into a ball sticks it on the top of the bone. After being
          left for some time in the bosom of a dead body, in order that it
          may derive a deadly potency by contact with corruption, the magical
          implement is set up in the ground near the fire, and as the ball
          melts, so the person against whom the charm is directed wastes with
          disease; if the ball is melted quite away, the victim will die.

          "Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> When the bewitched
          man learns of the spell that is being cast upon him, he endeavours
          to buy the bone from the sorcerer, and if he obtains it he breaks
          the charm by throwing the bone into a river or lake.<a id=

          Further, the Narrinyeri think that if a man eats of the totem
          animal of his tribe, and an enemy obtains a portion of the flesh,
          the latter can make it grow in the inside of the eater, and so
          cause his death. Therefore when a man partakes of his totem he is
          careful either to eat it all or else to conceal or destroy the
          refuse.<a id="noteref_471" name="noteref_471" href=

          the Encounter Bay tribe of South Australia, when a man cannot get
          the bone of an animal which his enemy has eaten, he cooks a bird,
          beast, or fish, and keeping back one of the creature's bones,
          offers the rest under the guise of friendship to his enemy. If the
          man is simple enough to partake of the proffered food, he is at the
          mercy of his perfidious foe, who can kill him by placing the
          abstracted bone near the fire.<a id="noteref_472" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ideas and
          practices of the same sort prevail, or used to prevail, in
          Melanesia; all that was needed to injure a man was to bring the
          leavings of his food into contact with a malignant ghost or spirit.
          Hence in the island of Florida when a scrap of an enemy's dinner
          was secreted and thrown into a haunted place, the man was supposed
          to fall ill; and in the New Hebrides if a snake of a certain sort
          carried away a fragment of food to a spot sacred to a spirit, the
          man who had eaten the food would sicken as the fragment decayed. In
          Aurora the refuse is made up by the wizard with certain leaves; as
          these rot and stink, the man dies. Hence it is, or was, a constant
          care with the Melanesians to prevent the remains of their meals
          from falling into the hands of persons who bore them a grudge; for
          this reason they regularly gave the refuse of food to the
          pigs.<a id="noteref_473" name="noteref_473" href=

          food, lest these should fall into the hands of the disease-makers.
          For if a disease-maker finds the remnants of a meal, say the skin
          of a banana, he picks it up and burns it slowly in the fire. As it
          burns, the person who ate the banana falls ill and sends to the
          disease-maker, offering him presents if he will stop burning the
          banana skin.<a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href=

          German New Guinea the natives take the utmost care to destroy or
          conceal the husks and other remains of their food, lest these
          should be found by their enemies and used by them for the injury or
          destruction of the eaters. Hence they burn their leavings, throw
          them into the sea, or otherwise put them out of harm's way. To such
          an extent does this fear influence them that many people dare not
          stir beyond the territory of their own village, lest they should
          leave behind them on the land of their neighbours something by
          means of which a hostile sorcerer might do them a mischief.<a id=

          Similar fears have led to similar customs in New Britain and the
          other islands of what is now called the Bismarck Archipelago, off
          the north coast of New Guinea. There also the natives bury, burn,
          or throw into the sea the remains of their meals to prevent them
          from falling into the hands of magicians; there also the more
          superstitious of them will not eat in another village because they
          dread the use which a sorcerer might make of their leavings when
          their back is turned. This theory has led to an odd practical
          result; all the cats in the islands of the Archipelago go about
          with stumpy tails. The reason of the peculiarity is this. The
          natives sometimes roast and eat their cats; and unscrupulous
          persons might be tempted to steal a neighbour's cat in order to
          furnish a meal. Accordingly, in the interests of the higher
          morality people remove this stumbling-block from the path of their
          weaker brothers by docking their cats of a piece of their tails and
          keeping the severed portions in a secret place. If <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> now a cat is stolen and eaten, the
          lawful owner of the animal has it in his power to avenge the crime:
          he need only bury the piece of tail with certain spells in the
          ground, and the thief will fall ill. Hence a man will hardly dare
          to steal and eat a cat with a stumpy tail, knowing the righteous
          retribution that would sooner or later overtake him for so
          doing.<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          superstitious fear of the magic that may be wrought on a man
          through the leavings of his food has had the beneficial effect of
          inducing many savages to destroy refuse which, if left to rot,
          might through its corruption have proved a real, not a merely
          imaginary, source of disease and death. Nor is it only the sanitary
          condition of a tribe which has benefited by this superstition;
          curiously enough the same baseless dread, the same false notion of
          causation, has indirectly strengthened the moral bonds of
          hospitality, honour, and good faith among men who entertain it. For
          it is obvious that no one who intends to harm a man by working
          magic on the refuse of his food will himself partake of that food,
          because if he did so he would, on the principles of sympathetic
          magic, suffer equally with his enemy from any injury done to the
          refuse. This is the idea which in primitive society lends sanctity
          to the bond produced by eating together; by participation in the
          same food two men give, as it were, hostages for their good
          behaviour; each guarantees the other that he will devise no
          mischief against him, since, being physically united with him by
          the common food in their stomachs, any harm he might do to his
          fellow would recoil on his own head with precisely the same force
          with which it fell on the head of his victim. In strict logic,
          however, the sympathetic bond lasts only so long as the food is in
          the stomach of each of the parties. Hence the covenant formed by
          eating together is less solemn and durable than the covenant formed
          by transfusing the blood of the covenanting parties into each
          other's veins, for this transfusion seems to knit them together for
          life.<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href=

          character to which attention has been already called. The divine
          person is a source of danger as well as of blessing; he must not
          only be guarded, he must also be guarded against. His sacred
          organism, so delicate that a touch may disorder it, is also, as it
          were, electrically charged with a powerful magical or spiritual
          force which may discharge itself with fatal effect on whatever
          comes in contact with it. Accordingly the isolation of the man-god
          is quite as necessary for the safety of others as for his own. His
          magical virtue is in the strictest sense of the word contagious:
          his divinity is a fire, which, under proper restraints, confers
          endless blessings, but, if rashly touched or allowed to break
          bounds, burns and destroys what it touches. Hence the disastrous
          effects supposed to attend a breach of taboo; the offender has
          thrust his hand into the divine fire, which shrivels up and
          consumes him on the spot. The Nubas, for example, who inhabit the
          wooded and fertile range of Jebel Nuba in eastern Africa, believe
          that they would die if they entered the house of their priestly
          king; however they can evade the penalty of their intrusion by
          baring the left shoulder and getting the king to lay his hand on
          it. And were any man to sit on a stone which the king has

          can touch him without being killed by the magical power which
          pervades his sacred person. But since contact with him is sometimes
          unavoidable, they have devised a means whereby the sinner can

          lays the palm of his hand on the palm of the king's hand, then
          snaps his fingers again. This ceremony is repeated four or five
          times, and averts the imminent danger of death.<a id="noteref_486"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a> In
          Tonga it was believed that if any one fed himself with his own
          hands after touching the sacred person of a superior chief or
          anything that belonged to him, he would swell up and die; the
          sanctity of the chief, like a virulent poison, infected the hands
          of his inferior, and, being communicated through them to the food,
          proved fatal to the eater. A commoner who had incurred this danger
          could disinfect himself by performing a certain ceremony, which
          consisted in touching the sole of a chief's foot with the palm and
          back of each of his hands, and afterwards rinsing his hands in
          water. If there was no water near, he rubbed his hands with the
          juicy stem of a plantain or banana. After that he was free to feed
          himself with his own hands without danger of being attacked by the
          malady which would otherwise follow from eating with tabooed or
          sanctified hands. But until the ceremony of expiation or
          disinfection had been performed, if he wished to eat, he had either
          to get some one to feed him, or else to go down on his knees and
          pick up the food from the ground with his mouth like a beast. He
          might not even use a toothpick himself, but might guide the hand of
          another person holding the toothpick. The Tongans were subject to
          induration of the liver and certain forms of scrofula, which they
          often attributed to a failure to perform the requisite expiation
          after having inadvertently touched a chief or his belongings. Hence
          they often went through the ceremony as a precaution, without
          knowing that they had done anything to call for it. The king of
          Tonga could not refuse to play his part in the rite by presenting
          his foot to such as desired to touch it, even when they applied to
          him at an inconvenient time. A fat unwieldy king, who perceived his
          subjects approaching with this intention, while he chanced to be
          taking his walks abroad, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg
          134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          has been sometimes seen to waddle as fast as his legs could carry
          him out of their way, in order to escape the importunate and not
          wholly disinterested expression of their homage. If any one fancied
          he might have already unwittingly eaten with tabooed hands, he sat
          down before the chief, and, taking the chief's foot, pressed it
          against his own stomach, that the food in his belly might not
          injure him, and that he might not swell up and die.<a id=

          scrofula was regarded by the Tongans as a result of eating with
          tabooed hands, we may conjecture that persons who suffered from it
          among them often resorted to the touch or pressure of the king's
          foot as a cure for their malady. The analogy of the custom with the
          old English practice of bringing scrofulous patients to the king to
          be healed by his touch is sufficiently obvious, and suggests, as I
          have already pointed out elsewhere, that among our own remote
          ancestors scrofula may have obtained its name of the King's Evil,
          from a belief, like that of the Tongans, that it was caused as well
          as cured by contact with the divine majesty of kings.<a id=

          the dread of the sanctity of chiefs was at least as great as in

          instance, it once happened that a New Zealand chief of high rank
          and great sanctity had left the remains of his dinner by the
          wayside. A slave, a stout, hungry fellow, coming up after the chief
          had gone, saw the unfinished dinner, and ate it up without asking
          questions. Hardly had he finished when <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          spectator that the food of which he had eaten was the chief's.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I knew the unfortunate delinquent well. He
          was remarkable for courage, and had signalised himself in the wars
          of the tribe,”</span> but <span class="tei tei-q">“no sooner did he
          hear the fatal news than he was seized by the most extraordinary
          convulsions and cramp in the stomach, which never ceased till he
          died, about sundown the same day. He was a strong man, in the prime
          of life, and if any pakeha [European] freethinker should have said
          he was not killed by the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          been communicated to the food by contact, he would have been

          is not a solitary case. A Maori woman having eaten of some fruit,
          and being afterwards told that the fruit had been taken from a
          tabooed place, exclaimed that the spirit of the chief, whose
          sanctity had been thus profaned, would kill her. This was in the
          afternoon, and next day by twelve o'clock she was dead.<a id=

          Maori chief's tinder-box was once the means of killing several
          persons; for, having been lost by him, and found by some men who
          used it to light their pipes, they died of fright on learning to
          whom it had belonged. So, too, the garments of a high New Zealand
          chief will kill any one else who wears them. A chief was observed
          by a missionary to throw down a precipice a blanket which he found
          too heavy to carry. Being asked by the missionary why he did not
          leave it on a tree for the use of a future traveller, the chief
          replied that <span class="tei tei-q">“it was the fear of its being
          taken by another which caused him to throw it where he did, for if
          it were worn, his tapu”</span> (that is, his spiritual power
          communicated by contact to the blanket and through the blanket to
          the man) <span class="tei tei-q">“would <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class=

          similar reason a Maori chief would not blow a fire with his mouth;
          for his sacred breath would communicate its sanctity to the fire,
          which would pass it on to the pot on the fire, which would pass it
          on to the meat in the pot, which would pass it on to the man who
          ate the meat, which was in the pot, which stood on the fire, which
          was breathed on by the chief; so that the eater, infected by the
          chief's breath conveyed through these intermediaries, would surely
          die.<a id="noteref_494" name="noteref_494" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in the
          Polynesian race, to which the Maoris belong, superstition erected
          round the persons of sacred chiefs a real, though at the same time
          purely imaginary barrier, to transgress which actually entailed the
          death of the transgressor whenever he became aware of what he had
          done. This fatal power of the imagination working through
          superstitious terrors is by no means confined to one race; it
          appears to be common among savages. For example, among the
          aborigines of Australia a native will die after the infliction of
          even the most superficial wound if only he believes that the weapon
          which inflicted the wound had been sung over and thus endowed with
          magical virtue. He simply lies down, refuses food, and pines

          Similarly among some of the Indian tribes of Brazil, if the
          medicine-man predicted the death of any one who had offended him,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the wretch took to his hammock instantly
          in such full expectation of dying, that he would neither eat nor

          Speaking of certain African races Major Leonard observes:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have seen more than one hardened old
          Haussa soldier dying steadily and by inches, because he believed

          mischief or to improve his condition in any way, and nothing was
          able to divert him from a fate which he considered inevitable. In
          the same way, and under very similar conditions, I have seen
          Kru-men and others die, in spite of every effort that was made to
          save them, simply because they had made <span class="tei tei-pb"

          Capuchin missionary Merolla da Sorrento, who travelled in the West
          African kingdom of Congo in the latter part of the seventeenth
          century, has described a remarkable case of death wrought purely by
          superstitious fear. He says: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is a
          custom that either the parents or the wizards give certain rules to
          be inviolably observed by the young people, and which they call
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chegilla</span></span>: these are to abstain
          from eating either some sorts of poultry, the flesh of some kinds
          of wild beasts, such and such fruits, roots either raw or boiled
          after this or another manner, with several other ridiculous
          injunctions of the like nature, too many to be enumerated here. You
          would wonder with what religious observance these commands are
          obeyed. These young people would sooner chuse to fast several days
          together, than to taste the least bit of what has been forbidden
          them; and if it sometimes happen that the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chegilla</span></span> has been neglected to
          have been given them by their parents, they think they shall
          presently die unless they go immediately to receive it from the
          wizards. A certain young negro, being upon a journey, lodged in a
          friend's house by the way: his friend, before he went out the next
          morning, had got a wild hen ready for his breakfast, they being
          much better than the tame ones. The negro hereupon demanded,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘If it were a wild hen?’</span> His host
          answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘No’</span>: then he fell on
          heartily, and afterwards proceeded on his journey. About four years
          after these two met together again, and the aforesaid negro being
          not yet married, his old friend asked him, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘If he would eat a wild hen?’</span> To which he
          answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘That he had received the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chegilla</span></span>, and therefore could
          not.’</span> Hereat the host began immediately to laugh, enquiring
          of him, <span class="tei tei-q">‘What made him refuse it now, when
          he had eaten one at his table about four years ago?’</span> At the
          hearing of this the negro immediately fell a trembling, and
          suffered himself to be so far possessed with the effects of
          imagination, that he died in less than twenty-four hours
          after.”</span><a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href=

          them the same sort of restraints that he lays on manslayers,
          menstruous women, and other persons whom he looks upon with a
          certain fear and horror. For example, sacred kings and priests in
          Polynesia were not allowed to touch food with their hands, and had
          therefore to be fed by others;<a id="noteref_499" name=

          as we have just seen, their vessels, garments, and other property
          might not be used by others on pain of disease and death. Now
          precisely the same observances are exacted by some savages from
          girls at their first menstruation, women after childbirth,
          homicides, mourners, and all persons who have come into contact
          with the dead. Thus, for example, to begin with the last class of
          persons, among the Maoris any one who had handled a corpse, helped
          to convey it to the grave, or touched a dead man's bones, was cut
          off from all intercourse and almost all communication with mankind.
          He could not enter any house, or come into contact with any person
          or thing, without utterly bedevilling them. He might not even touch
          food with his hands, which had become so frightfully tabooed or
          unclean as to be quite useless. Food would be set for him on the
          ground, and he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg
          139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          would then sit or kneel down, and, with his hands carefully held
          behind his back, would gnaw at it as best he could. In some cases
          he would be fed by another person, who with outstretched arm
          contrived to do it without touching the tabooed man; but the feeder
          was himself subjected to many severe restrictions, little less
          onerous than those which were imposed upon the other. In almost
          every populous village there lived a degraded wretch, the lowest of
          the low, who earned a sorry pittance by thus waiting upon the
          defiled. Clad in rags, daubed from head to foot with red ochre and
          stinking shark oil, always solitary and silent, generally old,
          haggard, and wizened, often half crazed, he might be seen sitting
          motionless all day apart from the common path or thoroughfare of
          the village, gazing with lack-lustre eyes on the busy doings in
          which he might never take a part. Twice a day a dole of food would
          be thrown on the ground before him to munch as well as he could
          without the use of his hands; and at night, huddling his greasy
          tatters about him, he would crawl into some miserable lair of
          leaves and refuse, where, dirty, cold, and hungry, he passed, in
          broken ghost-haunted slumbers, a wretched night as a prelude to
          another wretched day. Such was the only human being deemed fit to
          associate at arm's length with one who had paid the last offices of
          respect and friendship to the dead. And when, the dismal term of
          his seclusion being over, the mourner was about to mix with his
          fellows once more, all the dishes he had used in his seclusion were
          diligently smashed, and all the garments he had worn were carefully
          thrown away, lest they should spread the contagion of his
          defilement among others,<a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500"

          as the vessels and clothes of sacred kings and chiefs are destroyed
          or cast away for a similar reason. So complete in these respects is
          the analogy which the savage traces between the spiritual
          influences that emanate from divinities and from the dead, between
          the odour of sanctity and the stench of corruption.</p><span class=

          Again, in Tonga, <span class="tei tei-q">“no person can touch a
          dead chief without being taboo'd for ten lunar months, except
          chiefs, who are only taboo'd for three, four, or five months,
          according to the superiority of the dead chief; except again it be
          the body of Tooitonga [the great divine chief], and then even the
          greatest chief would be taboo'd ten months, as was the case with
          Finow's wife above mentioned. During the time a man is taboo'd he
          must not feed himself with his own hands, but must be fed by
          somebody else: he must not even use a toothpick himself, but must
          guide another person's hand holding the toothpick. If he is hungry
          and there is no one to feed him, he must go down upon his hands and
          knees, and pick up his victuals with his mouth: and if he infringes
          upon any of these rules, it is firmly expected that he will swell
          up and die: and this belief is so strong that Mr. Mariner thinks no
          native ever made an experiment to prove the contrary. They often
          saw him feed himself with his hands after having touched dead
          chiefs, and not observing his health to decline, they attributed it
          to his being a foreigner, and being governed by different
          gods.”</span><a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502" href=

          Again, in Wallis Island <span class="tei tei-q">“contact with a
          corpse subjects the hands to the law of taboo till they are washed,
          which is not done for several weeks. Until that purification has
          taken place, the tabooed persons may not themselves put food to
          their mouths; other people render them that service.”</span><a id=

          or was observed in various parts of Melanesia. Thus in Fiji the
          taboo for handling a dead chief lasted from one to ten months
          according to his rank; for a commoner it lasted not more than four
          days. It was commonly resorted to by the lazy and idle; for during
          the time of their seclusion they were not only provided with food,
          but were actually fed by attendants or ate their food from the
          ground.<a id="noteref_504" name="noteref_504" href=

          Similarly in the Motu tribe of New Guinea a man is tabooed,
          generally for three days, after handling a corpse, and while the
          taboo lasts he may not touch food with his hands. At the end of the
          time he bathes and the taboo is over.<a id="noteref_505" name=

          New Caledonia the two men who are charged with the duty of burying
          and guarding a corpse have to remain in seclusion and observe a
          number of rules of abstinence. They live apart from their wives.
          They may not shave or cut their hair. Their food is laid for them
          on leaves and they take it up with their mouth or a stick; but
          oftener an attendant feeds them, just as he might feed a man whose
          limbs were palsied.<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href=

          among the Nandi of British East Africa persons who have handled a
          corpse bathe in a river, anoint their bodies with fat, partially
          shave their heads, and live in the hut of the deceased for four
          days. All these days they may not be seen by boys or women: they
          may not drink milk; and they may not touch food with their hands,
          but must eat it with the help of a potsherd or chip of a
          gourd.<a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507" href=

          Similarly in the Ba-Pedi and Ba-Thonga tribes of South Africa men
          who have dug a grave may not touch food with their fingers till the
          rites of their purification are accomplished; meantime they eat
          with the help of special spoons. If they broke this rule, it is
          thought that they would be consumptive.<a id="noteref_508" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Shuswap of British Columbia widows and widowers in mourning are
          secluded and forbidden to touch their own head or body; the cups
          and cooking-vessels which they use may be used by no one else. They
          must build a sweat-house beside a creek, sweat there all night and
          bathe regularly, after which they must rub their bodies with
          branches of spruce. The branches may not be used more than once,
          and when they have served their purpose they are stuck into the
          ground all round the hut. No hunter would come near such mourners,
          for their presence is unlucky. If their shadow were to fall on any
          one, he would be taken ill at once. They employ thorn bushes for
          bed and pillow, in order to keep away the ghost of the deceased;
          and thorn bushes are also laid all around their beds.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">510</span></span></a> This
          last precaution shews clearly what the spiritual danger is which
          leads to the exclusion of such persons from ordinary society; it is
          simply a fear of the ghost who is supposed to be hovering near
          them. Among the Thompson Indians of British Columbia the persons
          who handled a corpse and dug the grave were secluded for four days.
          They fasted until the body was buried, after which they were given
          food apart from the other people. They would not touch the food
          with their hands, but must put it into their mouths with
          sharp-pointed sticks. They ate off a small mat, and drank out of
          birch-bark cups, which, together with the mat, were thrown away at
          the end of the four days. The first four mouthfuls of food, as well
          as of water, had to be spit into the fire. During their seclusion
          they bathed in a stream and might not sleep with their wives.
          Widows and widowers were obliged to observe rules of a similar
          kind. Immediately after the death they went out and passed through
          a patch of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg
          143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          rose-bushes four times, probably in order to rid themselves of the
          ghost, who might be supposed to stick on a thorn. For a year they
          had to sleep on a bed of fir-boughs, on which sticks of rose-bushes
          were laid; many wore twigs of rose-bush and juniper in a piece of
          buckskin on their persons. The first four days they might not touch
          their food, but ate with sharp-pointed sticks and spat out the
          first four mouthfuls of each meal, and the first four of water,
          into the fire. A widower might not fish at another man's
          fishing-place or with another man's net; if he did, it would make
          the place and the net useless for the season. If he transplanted a
          trout into another lake, before releasing it he blew on the head of
          the fish, and after chewing deer-fat, he spat some of the grease on
          its head in order to remove the baneful effect of his touch. Then
          he let the trout go, bidding it farewell, and asking it to
          propagate its kind in plenty. Any grass or branches that a widow or
          widower sat or lay down on withered up. If a widow should break
          sticks or boughs, her hands or arms would also break. She might not
          pick berries for a year, else the whole crop of berries would fall
          off the bushes or wither up. She might not cook food or fetch water
          for her children, nor let them lie down on her bed, nor should she
          lie or sit where they slept. Sometimes a widow would wear a
          breech-cloth made of dry bunch-grass for several days to prevent
          her husband's ghost from having intercourse with her.<a id=

          teeth: they may not drink out of a vessel in common use, but must
          employ a gourd which they carry about for the purpose; and they

          likely to meet anybody, for whoever looks upon her dies a sudden
          death. To prevent this fatal catastrophe, the widow knocks with a

          her dangerous proximity; and the very trees on which she knocks
          soon die.<a id="noteref_514" name="noteref_514" href=

          poisonous is the atmosphere of death that surrounds those to whom
          the ghost of the departed may be thought to cleave. In the Mekeo
          district of British New Guinea a widower loses all his civil rights
          and becomes a social outcast, an object of fear and horror, shunned
          by all. He may not cultivate a garden, nor shew himself in public,
          nor traverse the village, nor walk on the roads and paths. Like a
          wild beast he must skulk in the long grass and the bushes; and if
          he sees or hears any one coming, especially a woman, he must hide
          behind a tree or a thicket. If he wishes to fish or hunt, he must

          missionary, he does so by stealth and at night; he seems to have
          lost his voice and speaks only in whispers. Were he to join a party
          of fishers or hunters, his presence would bring misfortune on them;
          the ghost of his dead wife would frighten away the fish or the

          tribes, hardly any other being was the object of so much dread as a
          menstruating woman. As soon as signs of that condition made
          themselves apparent in a young girl she was carefully segregated
          from all but female company, and had to live by herself in a small
          hut away from the gaze of the villagers or of the male members of
          the roving band. While in that awful state, she had to abstain from
          touching anything belonging to man, or the spoils of any venison or
          other animal, lest she would thereby pollute the same, and condemn

          use for her food are banana leaves, which, when she has done with
          them, she throws away in some sequestered spot; for were a cow to
          find them and eat them, the animal would waste away and perish. And
          she drinks out of a special vessel for a like reason; because if
          any one drank out of the same cup after her, he would surely
          die.<a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href=

          the islands of Mabuiag and Saibai, in Torres Straits, girls at
          their first menstruation are strictly secluded from the sight of

          fortnight. During the time of her separation the girl is forbidden
          to feed herself or to handle food, which is put into her mouth by
          women or girls told off to wait on her.<a id="noteref_524" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among many
          peoples similar restrictions are imposed on women in childbed and
          apparently for similar reasons; at such periods women are supposed
          to be in a dangerous condition which would infect any person or
          thing they might touch; hence they are put into quarantine until,
          with the recovery of their health and strength, the imaginary
          danger has passed away. Thus, in Tahiti a woman after childbirth
          was secluded for a fortnight or three weeks in a temporary hut
          erected on sacred ground; during the time of her seclusion she was
          debarred from touching provisions, and had to be fed by another.
          Further, if any one else touched the child at this period, he was
          subjected to the same restrictions as the mother until the ceremony
          of her purification had been performed.<a id="noteref_525" name=

          Similarly in Manahiki, an island of the Southern Pacific, for ten
          days after her delivery a woman was not allowed to handle food, and
          had to be fed by some other person.<a id="noteref_526" name=

          148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a
          woman may not prepare or handle food; she may not even cook for
          herself, and when she is eating the food made ready for her by her
          friends she must use a sharpened stick to transfer it to her
          mouth.<a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href=

          Similarly in the Roro and Mekeo districts of British New Guinea a
          woman after childbirth becomes for a time taboo (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">opu</span></span>), and any person or thing
          she may chance to touch becomes taboo also. Accordingly during this
          time she abstains from cooking; for were she to cook food, not only
          the victuals themselves but the pot and the fire would be tabooed,
          so that nobody could eat the victuals, or use the pot, or warm
          himself at the fire. Further at meals she may not dip her hand into
          the dish and help herself, as the natives commonly do; she must use
          for the purpose a long fork, with which she takes up the bananas,
          sweet potatoes, yams, and so forth, in order not to contaminate the
          rest of the food in the vessel by the touch of her fingers. If she
          wishes to drink, a gourd is set before her, and wrapping up her
          hands in a cloth or coco-nut fibre she pours the water into a small
          calabash for her use; or she may pour the water directly into her
          mouth without letting the gourd touch her lips. If anything has to
          be handed to her, it is not given from hand to hand but reached to
          her at the end of a long stick.<a id="noteref_528" name=

          Similarly in the island of Kadiak, off Alaska, a woman about to be
          delivered retires to a miserable low hovel built of reeds, where
          she must remain for twenty days after the birth of her child,
          whatever the season may be, and she is considered so unclean that
          no one will touch her, and food is reached to her on sticks.<a id=

          the Ba-Pedi and Ba-Thonga tribes of South Africa a woman in
          childbed may not touch her food with her hands all the time of her

          "Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> They think that if
          she touched her victuals she might infect them with her bloody
          flux, and that having partaken of such tainted food she would fall
          into a consumption.<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href=
          "#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a> The
          Bribri Indians regard the pollution of childbed as much more
          dangerous even than that of menstruation. When a woman feels her
          time approaching, she informs her husband, who makes haste to build
          a hut for her in a lonely spot. There she must live alone, holding
          no converse with anybody save her mother or another woman. After
          her delivery the medicine-man purifies her by breathing on her and
          laying an animal, it matters not what, upon her. But even this
          ceremony only mitigates her uncleanness into a state considered to
          be equivalent to that of a menstruous woman; and for a full lunar
          month she must live apart from her housemates, observing the same
          rules with regard to eating and drinking as at her monthly periods.
          The case is still worse, the pollution is still more deadly, if she
          has had a miscarriage or has been delivered of a stillborn child.
          In that case she may not go near a living soul: the mere contact
          with things she has used is exceedingly dangerous: her food is
          handed to her at the end of a long stick. This lasts generally for
          three weeks, after which she may go home subject only to the
          restrictions incident to an ordinary confinement.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a> Among
          the Adivi or forest Gollas of Southern India, when a woman feels
          the first pains of labour, she is turned clean out of the village
          and must take up her quarters in a little hut made of leaves or
          mats about two hundred yards away. In this hut she must bring forth
          her offspring unaided, unless a midwife can be fetched in time to
          be with her before the child is born; if the midwife arrives after
          the birth has taken place she may not go near the woman. For ninety
          days the mother lives in the hut by herself. If any one touches
          her, he or she becomes, like the mother herself, an outcast and is
          expelled from the village for three months, The woman's husband
          generally makes a little hut about fifty yards from hers and stays
          in it sometimes to watch over her, but he may not go near her on
          pain of being an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg
          150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          outcast for three months. Food is placed on the ground near the
          woman's hut and she takes it. On the fourth day after the birth a
          woman of the village goes to her and pours water on her, but may
          not come into contact with her. On the fifth day the villagers
          clear away the stones and thorny bushes from a patch of ground
          about ten yards on the village side of the hut, and to this
          clearing the woman removes her hut unaided; no one may help her to
          do so. On the ninth, fifteenth, and thirtieth days she again shifts
          her hut nearer and nearer to the village; and again once in each of
          the two following months she brings her hut still nearer. On the
          ninetieth day of her seclusion the woman is called out from her
          hut, washed, clad in clean clothes, and after being taken to the
          village temple is conducted to her own house by a man of the caste,
          who performs purificatory ceremonies.<a id="noteref_532" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These customs
          shew that in the opinion of some primitive peoples a woman at and
          after childbirth is pervaded by a certain dangerous influence which
          can infect anything and anybody she touches; so that in the
          interest of the community it becomes necessary to seclude her from
          society for a while until the virulence of the infection has passed
          away, when, after submitting to certain rites of purification, she
          is again free to mingle with her fellows. This dread of lying-in
          women appears to be widespread, for the practice of shutting them
          up at such times in lonely huts away from the rest of the people is
          very common. Sometimes the nature of the danger which is
          apprehended from them is explicitly stated. Thus in the island of
          Tumleo, off German New Guinea, after the birth of her first child a
          woman is shut up with her infant for five to eight days, during
          which no man, not even her husband, may see her; for the men think
          that were they to see her, their bodies would swell up and they
          would die.<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href=

          Apparently their notion is that the sight of a woman who has just
          been big with child will, on <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the principles of homoeopathic magic, make
          their bodies big also to bursting. The Sulka of New Britain imagine
          that, when a woman has been delivered of a child, the men become
          cowardly, weapons lose their force, and the slips which are to be
          planted out are deprived of their power of germinating. Hence they
          perform a ceremony which is intended to counteract this mysterious
          influence on men and plants. As soon as it is known that a woman
          has been brought to bed, all the male population of the village
          assembles in the men's clubhouse. Branches of a strong-smelling
          tree are fetched, the twigs are broken off, the leaves stripped off
          and put on the fire. All the men present then seize branches with
          young buds. One of them holds ginger in his hand, which, after
          reciting a spell over it, he distributes to the others. They chew
          it and spit it out on the twigs, and these twigs are afterwards
          laid on the shields and other weapons in the house, and also on the
          slips which are to be planted; moreover they are fastened on the
          roofs and over the doorways of the houses. In this way they seek to
          annul the noxious infection of childbirth.<a id="noteref_534" name=

          Apparently they fear that if they went out to their fields and
          gardens immediately after a woman had been brought to bed, they
          would carry with them a dangerous contagion which might blight the
          crops. When a Herero woman has given birth to a child, her female
          companions hastily construct a special hut for her to which she is
          transferred. Both the hut and the woman are sacred and <span class=

          for example, the Ba-Pedi believe that a woman who has procured
          abortion can kill a man merely by lying with him; her victim is
          poisoned, shrivels up, and dies within a week. As for the
          disastrous effect which a miscarriage may have on the whole country
          I will quote the words of a medicine-man and rain-maker of the
          Ba-Pedi tribe: <span class="tei tei-q">“When a woman has had a
          miscarriage, when she has allowed her blood to flow, and has hidden
          the child, it is enough to cause the burning winds to blow and to
          parch the country with heat. The rain no longer falls, for the
          country is no longer in order. When the rain approaches the place
          where the blood is, it will not dare to approach. It will fear and
          remain at a distance. That woman has committed a great fault. She
          has spoiled the country of the chief, for she has hidden blood
          which had not yet been well congealed to fashion a man. That blood
          is taboo (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">yila</span></span>). It should never drip on
          the road! The chief will assemble his men and say to them,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Are you in order in your villages?’</span>
          Some one will answer, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Such and such a
          woman was pregnant and we have not yet seen the child which she has
          given birth to.’</span> Then they go and arrest the woman. They say
          to her, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Shew us where you have hidden
          it.’</span> They go and dig at the spot, they sprinkle the hole
          with a decoction of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mbendoula</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nyangale</span></span> (two sorts of roots)
          prepared in a special pot. They take a little of the earth of this
          grave, they throw it into the river, then they bring back water
          from the river and sprinkle it where she shed her blood. She
          herself must wash every day with the medicine. Then the country
          will be moistened again (by rain). Further, we (medicine-men)
          summon the women of the country; we tell them to prepare a ball of
          the earth which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg
          154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          contains the blood. They bring it to us one morning. If we wish to
          prepare medicine with which to sprinkle the whole country, we
          crumble this earth to powder; at the end of five days we send
          little boys and little girls, girls that yet know nothing of
          women's affairs and have not yet had relations with men. We put the
          medicine in the horns of oxen, and these children go to all the
          fords, to all the entrances of the country. A little girl turns up
          the soil with her mattock, the others dip a branch in the horn and
          sprinkle the inside of the hole saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Rain! rain!’</span> So we remove the misfortune which
          the women have brought on the roads; the rain will be able to come.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Similarly the
          Ba-Thonga, another Bantu tribe of South Africa in the valley of the
          Limpopo river, attribute severe droughts to the concealment of
          miscarriages by women, and they perform the following rites to
          remove the pollution and procure rain. A small clearing is made in
          a thick and thorny wood, and here a pot is buried in the ground so
          that its mouth is flush with the surface. From the pot four
          channels run in the form of a cross to the four cardinal points of
          the horizon. Then a black ox or a black ram, without a speck of
          white on it, is killed and the pot is stuffed with the
          half-digested grass found in the animal's stomach. Next, little
          girls, still in the age of innocence, are sent to draw water, which
          they pour into the pot till it overflows into the four channels.
          After that the women assemble, strip off their clothes, and
          covering their nakedness only with a scanty petticoat of grass they
          dance, leap, and sing, <span class="tei tei-q">“Rain, fall!”</span>
          Then they go and dig up the remains of the prematurely born infants
          and of twins buried in dry ground on a hill. These they collect in
          one place. No man may approach the spot. The women would beat any
          male who might be so indiscreet as to intrude on their privacy, and
          they would put riddles to him which he would have to answer in the
          most filthy language borrowed from the circumcision ceremonies; for
          obscene words, which are usually forbidden, are customary and
          legitimate on these occasions. The women pour water on the graves
          of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg
          155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">timula</span></span>) them, as the natives
          phrase it; which seems to imply that the graves are thought to be
          the source of the scorching heat which is blasting the country. At
          the fall of evening they bury all the remains they have discovered,
          poking them away in the mud near a stream. Then the rain will be
          free to fall.<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href=

          these ceremonies the pouring of water into channels which run in
          the direction of the four quarters of the heaven is clearly a charm
          based on the principles of homoeopathic magic to procure rain. The
          supposed influence of twins over the waters of heaven and the use
          of foul language at rain-making ceremonies have been illustrated in

          always fumigates himself with tea leaves or some other plant in
          order to rid himself of the infection which he has contracted; for
          they fear that the blood of the woman who has been brought to bed
          may harm the patient. All the time a house is tainted with the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          attainment of puberty; hence we may infer that at such times young
          men are supposed to be in a state like that of women at
          menstruation and in childbed. Thus, among the Creek Indians a lad
          at initiation had to abstain for twelve moons from picking his ears
          or scratching his head with his fingers; he had to use a small
          stick for these purposes. For four moons he must have a fire of his
          own to cook his food at; and a little girl, a virgin, might cook
          for him. During the fifth moon any person might cook for him, but
          he must serve himself first, and use one spoon and pan. On the
          fifth day of the twelfth moon he gathered corn cobs, burned them to
          ashes, and with the ashes rubbed his body all over. At the end of
          the twelfth moon he sweated under blankets, and then bathed in
          water, which ended the ceremony. While the ceremonies lasted, he
          might touch no one but lads who were undergoing a like course of
          initiation.<a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once more,
          warriors are conceived by the savage to move, so to say, in an
          atmosphere of spiritual danger which constrains them to practise a
          variety of superstitious observances quite different in their
          nature from those rational precautions which, as a matter of
          course, they adopt against foes of flesh and blood. The general
          effect of these observances is to place the warrior, both before
          and after victory, in the same state of seclusion or spiritual
          quarantine in which, for his own safety, primitive man puts his
          human gods and other dangerous characters. Thus when the Maoris
          went out on the war-path they were sacred or taboo in the highest
          degree, and they and their friends at home had to observe strictly
          many curious customs over and above the numerous taboos of ordinary
          life. They became, in the irreverent language of Europeans who knew
          them in the old fighting days, <span class="tei tei-q">“tabooed an
          inch thick”</span>; and as for the leader of the expedition, he was
          quite unapproachable.<a id="noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a>
          Similarly, when the Israelites marched forth to war they were bound
          by certain rules of ceremonial purity identical with rules observed
          by Maoris and Australian blackfellows on the war-path. The vessels
          they used were sacred, and they had to practise continence and a
          custom of personal cleanliness of which the original motive, if we
          may judge from the avowed motive of savages who conform to the same
          custom, was a fear lest the enemy should obtain <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the refuse of their persons, and thus
          be enabled to work their destruction by magic.<a id="noteref_548"
          name="noteref_548" href="#note_548"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a> Among
          some Indian tribes of North America a young warrior in his first
          campaign had to conform to certain customs, of which two were
          identical with the observances imposed by the same Indians on girls
          at their first menstruation: the vessels he ate and drank out of
          might be touched by no other person, and he was forbidden to
          scratch his head or any other part of his body with his fingers; if
          he could not help scratching himself, he had to do it with a
          stick.<a id="noteref_549" name="noteref_549" href=
          "#note_549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a> The
          latter rule, like the one which forbids a tabooed person to feed
          himself with his own fingers, seems to rest on the supposed
          sanctity or pollution, whichever we choose to call it, of the
          tabooed hands.<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href=

          159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          among these Indian tribes the men on the war-path had always to
          sleep at night with their faces turned towards their own country;
          however uneasy the posture they might not change it. They might not
          sit upon the bare ground, nor wet their feet, nor walk on a beaten
          path if they could help it; when they had no choice but to walk on
          a path, they sought to counteract the ill effect of doing so by
          doctoring their legs with certain medicines or charms which they
          carried with them for the purpose. No member of the party was
          permitted to step over the legs, hands, or body of any other member
          who chanced to be sitting or lying on the <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> ground; and it was equally forbidden to step
          over his blanket, gun, tomahawk, or anything that belonged to him.
          If this rule was inadvertently broken, it became the duty of the
          member whose person or property had been stepped over to knock the
          other member down, and it was similarly the duty of that other to
          be knocked down peaceably and without resistance. The vessels out
          of which the warriors ate their food were commonly small bowls of
          wood or birch bark, with marks to distinguish the two sides; in
          marching from home the Indians invariably drank out of one side of
          the bowl, and in returning they drank out of the other. When on
          their way home they came within a day's march of the village, they
          hung up all their bowls on trees, or threw them away on the
          prairie,<a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href=
          "#note_551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a>
          doubtless to prevent their sanctity or defilement from being
          communicated with disastrous effects to their friends, just as we
          have seen that the vessels and clothes of the sacred Mikado, of
          women at childbirth and menstruation, of boys at circumcision, and
          of persons defiled by contact with the dead are destroyed or laid
          aside for a similar reason. The first four times that an Apache
          Indian goes out on the war-path, he is bound to refrain from
          scratching his head with his fingers and from letting water touch
          his lips. Hence he scratches his head with a stick, and drinks
          through a hollow reed or cane. Stick and reed are attached to the
          warrior's belt and to each other by a leathern thong.<a id=

          four weeks before they went on a warlike expedition, the Nootka
          Indians made it an invariable rule to go into the water five or six
          times a day, when they washed and scrubbed themselves from head to
          foot with bushes intermixed with briars, so that their bodies and
          faces were often entirely covered with blood. During this severe
          exercise they continually exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Good

          find him asleep, and kill a great many of them.”</span> All this
          time they had no intercourse with their women, and for a week
          before setting out abstained from feasting and every kind of
          merriment. For the last three days they were almost constantly in
          the water, scrubbing and lacerating themselves in a terrible
          manner. They believed that this hardened their skin, so that the
          weapons of the enemy could not pierce them.<a id="noteref_554"

          rigorous fast, or rather abstain from every kind of food for four
          days. In this interval their imagination is exalted to delirium;
          whether it be through bodily weakness or the natural effect of the
          warlike plans they cherish, they pretend to have strange visions.
          The elders and sages of the tribe, being called upon to interpret
          these dreams, draw from them omens more or less favourable to the
          success of the enterprise; and their explanations are received as
          oracles by which the expedition will be faithfully regulated. So
          long as the preparatory fast continues, the warriors make incisions
          in their bodies, insert pieces of wood in the flesh, and having
          fastened leather thongs to them cause themselves to be hung from a
          beam which is fixed horizontally above an abyss a hundred and fifty
          feet deep. Often indeed they cut off one or two fingers which they
          offer in sacrifice to the Great Spirit in order that they may come

          hard to conceive any course of training which could more
          effectually incapacitate men for the business of war than that

          aforesaid winter house, and there drink a warm decoction of their
          supposed holy consecrated herbs and roots for three days and
          nights, sometimes without any other refreshment. This is to induce
          the deity to guard and prosper them, amidst their impending
          dangers. In the most promising appearance of things, they are not
          to take the least nourishment of food, nor so much as to sit down,
          during that time of sanctifying themselves, till after sunset.
          While on their expedition, they are not allowed to lean themselves
          against a tree, though they may be exceedingly fatigued, after a
          sharp day's march; nor must they lie by, a whole day to refresh
          themselves, or kill and barbicue deer and bear for their war
          journey. The more virtuous they are, they reckon the greater will
          be their success against the enemy, by the bountiful smiles of the
          deity. To gain that favourite point, some of the aged warriors
          narrowly watch the young men who are newly initiated, lest they
          should prove irreligious, and prophane the holy fast, and bring
          misfortunes on the out-standing camp. A gentleman of my
          acquaintance, in his youthful days observed one of their religious
          fasts, but under the greatest suspicion of his virtue in this
          respect, though he had often headed them against the common enemy:
          during their three days' purification, he was not allowed to go out
          of the sanctified ground, without a trusty guard, lest hunger
          should have tempted him to violate their old martial law, and by
          that means have raised the burning wrath of the holy fire against
          the whole camp.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Every war captain
          chuses a noted warrior, to attend on him and the company. He is
          called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          during their journey, he gives them out of his hand, by a rigid
          abstemious rule,—though each carries on his back all his travelling
          conveniencies, wrapt in a deer skin, yet they are so bigoted in
          their religious customs in war that none, though prompted by sharp
          hunger or burning thirst, dares relieve himself. They are contented
          with such trifling allowance as the religious waiter distributes to
          them, even with a scanty hand. Such a regimen would be too
          mortifying to any of the white people, let their opinion of its
          violation be ever so dangerous. When I roved the <span class=

          though I carried no scrip, nor bottle, nor staff, I kept a large
          hollow cane well corked at each end, and used to sheer off now and
          then to drink, while they suffered greatly by thirst. The constancy
          of the savages in mortifying their bodies, to gain the divine
          favour, is astonishing, from the very time they beat to arms, till
          they return from their campaign. All the while they are out, they
          are prohibited by ancient custom, the leaning against a tree,
          either sitting or standing; nor are they allowed to sit in the
          day-time, under the shade of trees, if it can be avoided; nor on
          the ground, during the whole journey, but on such rocks, stones, or
          fallen wood, as their ark of war rests upon. By the attention they
          invariably pay to those severe rules of living, they weaken
          themselves much more than by the unavoidable fatigues of war; but
          it is fruitless to endeavour to dissuade them from those things
          which they have by tradition, as the appointed means to move the
          deity, to grant them success against the enemy, and a safe return
          home.”</span><a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we observe

          their bodies, we shall probably not be disposed to attribute their
          practice of continence in war to a rational fear of dissipating
          their bodily energies by indulgence in the lusts of the flesh. On
          the contrary, we can scarcely doubt that the motive which impelled
          them to observe chastity on a campaign was just as frivolous as the
          motive which led them simultaneously to fritter away their strength
          by severe fasts, gratuitous fatigue, and voluntary wounds at the
          very moment when prudence called most loudly for a precisely
          opposite regimen. Why exactly so many savages have made it a rule
          to refrain from women in time of war,<a id="noteref_560" name=
          "noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> we
          cannot say for certain, but we may conjecture that their motive was
          a superstitious fear lest, on the principles of sympathetic magic,
          close contact with women should infect them with feminine weakness
          and cowardice. Similarly some savages imagine that contact with a
          woman in childbed enervates warriors and enfeebles their
          weapons.<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561" href=

          Indeed the Kayans of central Borneo go so far as to hold that to
          touch a loom or women's clothes would so weaken a man that he
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name=

          it is not merely sexual intercourse with women that the savage
          warrior sometimes shuns; he is careful to avoid the sex altogether.
          Thus among the hill tribes of Assam, not only are men forbidden to
          cohabit with their wives during or after a raid, but they may not
          eat food cooked by a woman; nay they should not address a word even
          to their own wives. Once a woman, who unwittingly broke the rule by
          speaking to her husband while he was under the war taboo, sickened
          and died when she learned the awful crime she had committed.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the reader
          still doubts whether the rules of conduct which we have just been
          considering are based on superstitious fears or dictated by a
          rational prudence, his doubts will probably be dissipated when he
          learns that rules of the same sort are often imposed even more
          stringently on warriors after the victory has been won and when all
          fear of the living corporeal foe is at an end. In such cases one
          motive for the inconvenient restrictions laid on the victors in
          their hour of triumph is probably a dread of the angry ghosts of
          the slain; and that the fear of the vengeful ghosts does influence
          the behaviour of the slayers is often expressly affirmed. The
          general effect of the taboos laid on sacred chiefs, mourners, women
          at childbirth, men on the war-path, and so on, is to seclude or
          isolate the tabooed persons from ordinary society, this effect
          being attained by a variety of rules, which oblige the men or women
          to live in separate huts or in the open air, to shun the commerce
          of the sexes, to avoid the use of vessels employed by others, and
          so forth. Now the same effect is produced by similar means in the
          case of victorious warriors, particularly such as have actually
          shed the blood of their enemies. In the island of Timor, when a
          warlike expedition has returned in triumph bringing the heads of
          the vanquished foe, the leader of the expedition is <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> forbidden by religion and custom to
          return at once to his own house. A special hut is prepared for him,
          in which he has to reside for two months, undergoing bodily and
          spiritual purification. During this time he may not go to his wife
          nor feed himself; the food must be put into his mouth by another
          person.<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href=
          "#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> That
          these observances are dictated by fear of the ghosts of the slain
          seems certain; for from another account of the ceremonies performed
          on the return of a successful head-hunter in the same island we
          learn that sacrifices are offered on this occasion to appease the
          soul of the man whose head has been taken; the people think that
          some misfortune would befall the victor were such offerings
          omitted. Moreover, a part of the ceremony consists of a dance
          accompanied by a song, in which the death of the slain man is
          lamented and his forgiveness is entreated. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Be not angry,”</span> they say, <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“a man who has taken life is considered to
          be impure until he has undergone certain ceremonies: as soon as
          possible after the deed he cleanses himself and his weapon. This
          satisfactorily accomplished, he repairs to his village and seats
          himself on the logs of sacrificial staging. No one approaches him
          or takes any notice whatever of him. A house is prepared for him
          which is put in charge of two or three small boys as servants. He
          may eat only toasted bananas, and only the centre portion of
          them—the ends being thrown away. On the third day of his seclusion
          a small feast is prepared by his friends, who also fashion some new
          perineal bands for him. This is called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ivi
          poro</span></span>. The next day the man dons all his best
          ornaments and badges for taking life, and sallies forth fully armed
          and parades the village. The next day a hunt is organised, and a
          kangaroo selected from the game captured. It is cut open and the
          spleen and liver rubbed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg

          over the back of the man. He then walks solemnly down to the
          nearest water, and standing straddle-legs in it washes himself. All
          the young untried warriors swim between his legs. This is supposed
          to impart courage and strength to them. The following day, at early
          dawn, he dashes out of his house, fully armed, and calls aloud the
          name of his victim. Having satisfied himself that he has thoroughly
          scared the ghost of the dead man, he returns to his house. The
          beating of flooring-boards and the lighting of fires is also a
          certain method of scaring the ghost. A day later his purification
          is finished. He can then enter his wife's house.”</span><a id=

          the Roro-speaking tribes of British New Guinea homicides were
          secluded in the warriors' clubhouse. They had to pass the night in
          the building, but during the day they might paint and decorate
          themselves and dance in front of it. For some time they might not
          eat much food nor touch it with their hands, but were obliged to
          pick it up on a bone fork, the heft of which was wrapped in a
          banana leaf. After a while they bathed in the sea and thence
          forward for a period of about a month, though they had still to
          sleep in the warriors' clubhouse, they were free to eat as much
          food as they pleased and to pick it up with their bare hands.
          Finally, those warriors who had never killed a man before assumed a
          beautiful ornament made of fretted turtle shell, which none but
          homicides were allowed to flaunt in their head-dresses. Then came a
          dance, and that same night the men who wore the honourable badge of
          homicide for the first time were chased about the village; embers
          were thrown at them and firebrands waved in order, apparently, to
          drive away the souls of the dead enemies, who seem to be conceived
          as immanent in some way in the headgear of their slayers.<a id=

          Again, among the Koita of British New Guinea, when a man had killed
          another, whether the victim were male or female, he did not wash
          the blood off the spear or club, but carefully allowed it to dry on
          the weapon. On his way home he bathed in fresh or salt water, and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name=

          village went straight to his own house, where he remained in

          women, and he lifted his food to his mouth with a bone fork. His
          women-folk were not obliged to leave the house, but they might not
          come near him. At the end of a week he built a rough shelter in the
          forest, where he lived for a few days. During this time he made a
          new waist-band, which he wore on his return to the village. A man
          who has slain another is supposed to grow thin and emaciated,
          because he had been splashed with the blood of his victim, and as
          the corpse rotted he wasted away.<a id="noteref_572" name=

          to the village with a great noise, and the women stand ready to
          dance in the verandahs of the houses. The canoes row past the

          pass, the murderers throw as many pointed sticks or bamboos at the
          wall or the roof as there were enemies killed. The day is spent
          very quietly. Now and then they drum or blow on the conch; at other

          Similarly in the Doreh district of Dutch New Guinea, if a murder
          has taken place in the village, the inhabitants assemble for
          several evenings in succession and utter frightful yells to drive
          away the ghost of the victim in case he should be minded to hang

          the Yabim of German New Guinea believe that the spirit of a

          his ghost, lest he should attempt to return to his old home. And to

          would unquestionably have come at night to knock with sobs and

          slept the sleep of the just.<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581"

          temper of a man who has just been executed is naturally somewhat
          short, and in a burst of vexation his ghost is apt to fall foul of
          the first person he comes across, without discriminating between
          the objects of his wrath with that nicety of judgment which in
          calmer moments he may be expected to display. Hence in China it is,
          or used to be, customary for the spectators of an execution to shew
          a clean pair of heels to the ghosts as soon as the last head was
          off.<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href=

          same fear of the spirits of his victims leads the executioner
          sometimes to live in seclusion for some time after he has
          discharged his office. Thus an old writer, speaking of Issini on
          the Gold Coast of West Africa, tells us that the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“executioners, being reckoned impure for three days,
          they build them a separate hut at a distance from the village.
          Meantime these fellows run like madmen through the place, seizing
          all they can lay hands on; poultry, sheep, bread, and oil;
          everything they can touch is theirs; being deemed so polluted that
          the owners willingly give it up. They continue three days confined
          to their hut, their friends bringing them victuals. This time
          expired, they take their hut in pieces, which they <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> bundle up, not leaving so much as the
          ashes of their fire. The first executioner, having a pot on his
          head, leads them to the place where the criminal suffered. There
          they all call him thrice by his name. The first executioner breaks
          his pot, and leaving their old rags and bundles they all scamper
          home.”</span><a id="noteref_583" name="noteref_583" href=

          the thrice-repeated invocation of the victim by name gives the clue

          The ceremony takes place in the evening. An ox is slaughtered, and
          a hole having been made through the middle of the carcase with a
          spear, the manslayer has to force himself through the animal, while
          two men hold its stomach open.<a id="noteref_586" name=

          Sometimes instead of being obliged to squeeze through the carcase
          of an ox the manslayer is merely smeared with the contents of its
          stomach. The ceremony has been described as follows: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In the purification of warriors, too, the ox takes a
          conspicuous part. The warrior who has slain a man in the battle is
          unclean, and must on no account enter his own courtyard, for it
          would be a serious thing if even his shadow were to fall upon his
          children. He studiously keeps himself apart from the civil life of
          the town until he is purified. The purification ceremony is
          significant. Having bathed himself in running water, or, if that is
          not convenient, in water that has been appropriately medicated, he
          is smeared by the doctor with the contents of the stomach of an ox,
          into which certain powdered roots have been already mixed, and then
          the doctor strikes him on the back, sides, and belly with the large
          bowel of an ox.... A doctor takes a piece of roasted beef and cuts
          it into small lumps of about the size of a walnut, laying them
          carefully on a large wooden trencher. He has already prepared
          charcoal, by roasting the root of certain trees in an old cracked
          pot, and this he grinds down and sprinkles on the lumps of meat on
          the trencher. Then the army surrounds the trencher, and every one
          who has slain a foe in the battle steps forth, kneels down before
          the trencher, and takes out a piece of meat with his mouth, taking
          care not to touch it or the trencher with his hands. As he takes
          the meat, the doctor gives him a smart cut with a switch. And when
          he has eaten that lump of meat his purification is complete. This
          ceremony is called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-q">‘the purification of the

          description adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“This taking of meat from

          correct. Here as in so many cases persons ceremonially unclean are
          forbidden to touch food with defiled hands until their uncleanness
          has been purged away. The same taboo is laid on the manslayer by
          the Bageshu of British East Africa. Among them a man who has killed
          another may not return to his own house on the same day, though he
          may enter the village and spend the night in a friend's house. He
          kills a sheep and smears his chest, his right arm, and his head
          with the contents of the animal's stomach. His children are brought
          to him and he smears them in like manner. Then he smears each side
          of the doorway with the tripe and entrails, and finally throws the
          rest of the stomach on the roof of his house. For a whole day he
          may not touch food with his hands, but picks it up with two sticks
          and so conveys it to his mouth. His wife is not under any such
          restrictions. She may even go to mourn for the man whom her husband
          has killed, if she wishes to do so.<a id="noteref_588" name=

          persons, and tie bark ropes round their necks, so that the ends
          hang down over their shoulders or breasts. This costume they wear
          for three days after their return, and rising at break of day they
          run through the village uttering frightful yells to drive away the
          ghosts of the slain, which, if they were not thus banished from the

          man has then to take a stick, spit on it thrice, point it thrice at

          Amongst other things, he must be sure to make an incision in the
          corpse of his slain foe, in order to let the gases escape and so

          Herero warriors on their return from battle may not approach the
          sacred hearth until they have been purified from the guilt of
          bloodshed. They crouch in a circle round the hearth, but at some
          distance from it, while the chief besprinkles their brows and
          temples with water in which branches of a holy bush have been
          placed.<a id="noteref_598" name="noteref_598" href=

          Again, ancient Herero custom requires that he who has killed a man

          the Ja-Luo of Kavirondo the custom is somewhat different. Three
          days after his return from the fight the warrior shaves his head.
          But before he may enter his village he has to hang a live fowl,
          head uppermost, round his neck; then the bird is decapitated and
          its head left hanging round his neck. Soon after his return a feast
          is made for the slain man, in order that his ghost may not haunt
          his slayer.<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href=

          obliged to remain outside the camp for seven days: whoever had
          killed a man or touched the slain had to purify himself and his

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Arunta of
          central Australia believe that when a party of men has been out
          against the enemy and taken a life, the spirit of the slain man
          follows the party on its return and is constantly on the watch to
          do a mischief to those of the band who actually shed the blood. It
          takes the form of a little bird called the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chichurkna</span></span>, and may be heard
          crying like a child in the distance as it flies. If any of the
          slayers should fail to hear its cry, he would become paralysed in
          his right arm and shoulder. At night-time especially, when the bird
          is flying over the camp, the slayers have to lie awake and keep the
          right arm and shoulder carefully hidden, lest the bird should look
          down upon and harm them. When once they have <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> heard its cry their minds are at ease,
          because the spirit of the dead then recognises that he has been
          detected, and can therefore do no mischief. On their return to
          their friends, as soon as they come in sight of the main camp, they
          begin to perform an excited war-dance, approaching in the form of a
          square and moving their shields as if to ward off something which
          was being thrown at them. This action is intended to repel the
          angry spirit of the dead man, who is striving to attack them. Next
          the men who did the deed of blood separate themselves from the
          others, and forming a line, with spears at rest and shields held
          out in front, stand silent and motionless like statues. A number of
          old women now approach with a sort of exulting skip and strike the
          shields of the manslayers with fighting-clubs till they ring again.
          They are followed by men who smite the shields with boomerangs.
          This striking of the shields is supposed to be a very effective way
          of frightening away the spirit of the dead man. The natives listen
          anxiously to the sounds emitted by the shields when they are
          struck; for if any man's shield gives forth a hollow sound under
          the blow, that man will not live long, but if it rings sharp and
          clear, he is safe. For some days after their return the slayers
          will not speak of what they have done, and continue to paint
          themselves all over with powdered charcoal, and to decorate their
          foreheads and noses with green twigs. Finally, they paint their
          bodies and faces with bright colours, and become free to talk about
          the affair; but still of nights they must lie awake listening for
          the plaintive cry of the bird in which they fancy they hear the
          voice of their victim.<a id="noteref_605" name="noteref_605" href=

          mother, and children all together. As a rule they shewed a
          remarkable stolidity and indifference to death. The club with which
          they were to be despatched was elaborately prepared by the women,
          who adorned it with tassels of feathers, smeared it with the
          pounded shells of a macaw's eggs, and traced lines on the egg-shell
          powder. Then they hung it to a pole, above the ground, in an empty
          hut, and sang around it all night. The executioner, who was painted
          grey with ashes and his whole body covered with the beautiful
          feathers of parrots and other birds of gay plumage, performed his
          office by striking the victim on the head from behind and dashing
          out his brains. No sooner had he despatched the prisoner than he
          retired to his house, where he had to stay all that day without
          eating or drinking, while the rest of the people feasted on the
          body of the victim or victims. And for three days he was obliged to
          fast and remain in seclusion. All this time he lay in his hammock
          and might not set foot on the ground; if he had to go anywhere, he
          was carried by bearers. They thought that, were he to break this
          rule, some disaster would befall him or he would die. Meantime he
          was given a small bow and passed his time in shooting arrows into
          wax. This he did in order to keep his hand and aim steady. In some
          of the tribes they rubbed the pulse of the executioner with one of
          the eyes of his victim, and hung the mouth of the murdered man like
          a bracelet on his arm. Afterwards he made incisions in his breast,
          arms, and legs, and other parts of his body with a saw made of the
          teeth of an animal. An ointment and a black powder were then rubbed
          into the wounds, which left ineffaceable scars so artistically
          arranged that they presented the appearance of a tightly-fitting
          garment. It was believed that he would die if he did not thus draw
          blood from his own body after slaughtering the captive.<a id=

          months. They might not sleep with their wives nor eat flesh; their
          only food was fish and hasty-pudding. If they broke these rules,
          they believed that the soul of the man they had killed would work

          the enemy, and that the least wound inflicted on them would prove

          a Pima Indian has killed an Apache, he must undergo purification.
          Sixteen days he fasts, and only after the fourth day is he allowed
          to drink a little pinole. During the whole time he may not touch
          meat nor salt, nor look on a blazing fire, nor speak to a human
          being. He lives alone in the woods, waited on by an old woman, who
          brings him his scanty dole of food. He bathes often in a river, and
          keeps his head covered almost the whole time with a plaster of mud.
          On the seventeenth day a large space is cleared near the village
          and a fire lit in the middle of it. The men of the tribe form a
          circle round the fire, and outside of it sit all the warriors who
          have just been purified, each in a small excavation. Some of the
          old men then take the weapons of the purified and dance with them
          in the circle, after which both the slayer and his weapon are
          considered clean; but not until four days later is the man allowed
          to return to his family.<a id="noteref_616" name="noteref_616"

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> government of the United States has, along
          with tribal warfare, abolished also these quaint customs. A fuller
          account of them has been given by a recent writer, and it deserves
          to be quoted at length. <span class="tei tei-q">“There was no law
          among the Pimas,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“observed
          with greater strictness than that which required purification and
          expiation for the deed that was at the same time the most
          lauded—the killing of an enemy. For sixteen days the warrior fasted
          in seclusion and observed meanwhile a number of tabus.... Attended
          by an old man, the warrior who had to expiate the crime of blood
          guilt retired to the groves along the river bottom at some distance
          from the villages or wandered about the adjoining hills. During the
          period of sixteen days he was not allowed to touch his head with
          his fingers or his hair would turn white. If he touched his face it
          would become wrinkled. He kept a stick to scratch his head with,
          and at the end of every four days this stick was buried at the root
          and on the west side of a cat's claw tree and a new stick was made
          of greasewood, arrow bush, or any other convenient shrub. He then
          bathed in the river, no matter how cold the temperature. The feast
          of victory which his friends were observing in the meantime at the
          village lasted eight days. At the end of that time, or when his
          period of retirement was half-completed, the warrior might go to
          his home to get a fetish made from the hair of the Apache whom he
          had killed. The hair was wrapped in eagle down and tied with a
          cotton string and kept in a long medicine basket. He drank no water
          for the first two days and fasted for the first four. After that
          time he was supplied with pinole by his attendant, who also
          instructed him as to his future conduct, telling him that he must
          henceforth stand back until <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> all others were served when partaking of food
          and drink. If he was a married man his wife was not allowed to eat
          salt during his retirement, else she would suffer from the owl
          disease which causes stiff limbs. The explanation offered for the
          observance of this law of lustration is that if it is not obeyed
          the warrior's limbs will become stiffened or
          paralyzed.”</span><a id="noteref_617" name="noteref_617" href=
          "#note_617"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">617</span></span></a> The
          Apaches, the enemies of the Pimas, purify themselves for the
          slaughter of their foes by means of baths in the sweat-house,
          singing, and other rites. These ceremonies they perform for all the
          dead simultaneously after their return home; but the Pimas, more
          punctilious on this point, resort to their elaborate ceremonies of
          purification the moment a single one of their own band or of the
          enemy has been laid low.<a id="noteref_618" name="noteref_618"

          heavily these religious scruples must have told against the Pimas
          in their wars with their ferocious enemies is obvious enough.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“This long period of retirement immediately
          after a battle,”</span> says an American writer, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“greatly diminished the value of the Pimas as scouts
          and allies for the United States troops operating against the
          Apaches. The bravery of the Pimas was praised by all army officers
          having any experience with them, but Captain Bourke and others have
          complained of their unreliability, due solely to their rigid
          observance of this religious law.”</span><a id="noteref_619" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Far away from
          the torrid home of the Pima and Apaches, an old traveller witnessed
          ceremonies of the same sort practised near the Arctic Circle by
          some Indians who had surprised and brutally massacred an
          unoffending and helpless party of Esquimaux. His description is so
          interesting that I will quote it in full. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Among the various superstitious customs of those
          people, it is worth remarking, and ought to have been mentioned in
          its proper place, that immediately after my companions had killed
          the Esquimaux at the Copper River, they considered themselves in a
          state of uncleanness, which induced <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> them to practise some very curious and
          unusual ceremonies. In the first place, all who were absolutely
          concerned in the murder were prohibited from cooking any kind of
          victuals, either for themselves or others. As luckily there were
          two in company who had not shed blood, they were employed always as
          cooks till we joined the women. This circumstance was exceedingly
          favourable on my side; for had there been no persons of the above
          description in company, that task, I was told, would have fallen on
          me; which would have been no less fatiguing and troublesome, than
          humiliating and vexatious. When the victuals were cooked, all the
          murderers took a kind of red earth, or oker, and painted all the
          space between the nose and chin, as well as the greater part of
          their cheeks, almost to the ears, before they would taste a bit,
          and would not drink out of any other dish, or smoke out of any
          other pipe, but their own; and none of the others seemed willing to
          drink or smoke out of theirs. We had no sooner joined the women, at
          our return from the expedition, than there seemed to be an
          universal spirit of emulation among them, vying who should first
          make a suit of ornaments for their husbands, which consisted of
          bracelets for the wrists, and a band for the forehead, composed of
          porcupine quills and moose-hair, curiously wrought on leather. The
          custom of painting the mouth and part of the cheeks before each
          meal, and drinking and smoking out of their own utensils, was
          strictly and invariably observed, till the winter began to set in;
          and during the whole of that time they would never kiss any of
          their wives or children. They refrained also from eating many parts
          of the deer and other animals, particularly the head, entrails, and
          blood; and during their uncleanness, their victuals were never
          sodden in water, but dried in the sun, eaten quite raw, or broiled,
          when a fire fit for the purpose could be procured. When the time
          arrived that was to put an end to these ceremonies, the men,
          without a female being present, made a fire at some distance from
          the tents, into which they threw all their ornaments, pipe-stems,
          and dishes, which were soon consumed to ashes; after which a feast
          was prepared, consisting of such articles as they had long been
          prohibited from eating; and when all was over, each man was at
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name=
          "Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> liberty to eat,
          drink, and smoke as he pleased; and also to kiss his wives and
          children at discretion, which they seemed to do with more raptures
          than I had ever known them do it either before or
          since.”</span><a id="noteref_620" name="noteref_620" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we see that
          warriors who have taken the life of a foe in battle are temporarily
          cut off from free intercourse with their fellows, and especially
          with their wives, and must undergo certain rites of purification
          before they are readmitted to society. Now if the purpose of their
          seclusion and of the expiatory rites which they have to perform is,
          as we have been led to believe, no other than to shake off,
          frighten, or appease the angry spirit of the slain man,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name=
          "Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> we may safely
          conjecture that the similar purification of homicides and
          murderers, who have imbrued their hands in the blood of a
          fellow-tribesman, had at first the same significance, and that the
          idea of a moral or spiritual regeneration symbolised by the
          washing, the fasting, and so on, was merely a later interpretation
          put upon the old custom by men who had outgrown the primitive modes
          of thought in which the custom originated. The conjecture will be
          confirmed if we can shew that savages have actually imposed certain
          restrictions on the murderer of a fellow-tribesman from a definite
          fear that he is haunted by the ghost of his victim. This we can do
          with regard to the Omahas, a tribe of the Siouan stock in North
          America. Among these Indians the kinsmen of a murdered man had the
          right to put the murderer to death, but sometimes they waived their
          right in consideration of presents which they consented to accept.
          When the life of the murderer was spared, he had to observe certain
          stringent rules for a period which varied from two to four years.
          He must walk barefoot, and he might eat no warm food, nor raise his
          voice, nor look around. He was compelled to pull his robe about him
          and to have it tied at the neck even in hot weather; he might not
          let it hang loose or fly open. He might not move his hands about,
          but had to keep them close to his body. He might not comb his hair
          and it might not be blown about by the wind. When the tribe went
          out hunting, he was obliged to pitch his tent about a quarter of a
          mile from the rest of the people <span class="tei tei-q">“lest the
          ghost of his victim should raise a high wind, which might cause
          damage.”</span> Only one of his kindred was allowed to remain with
          him at his tent. No one wished to eat with him, for they said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“If we eat with him whom Wakanda hates
          Wakanda will hate us.”</span> Sometimes he wandered at night crying
          and lamenting his offence. At the end of his long isolation the
          kinsmen of the murdered man heard his crying and said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is enough. Begone, and walk among the crowd. Put on
          moccasins and wear a good robe.”</span><a id="noteref_621" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">621</span></span></a> Here
          the reason alleged for keeping the murderer at a considerable
          distance from the hunters gives the clue to all the other
          restrictions <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg
          188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          laid on him: he was haunted and therefore dangerous. The ancient
          Greeks believed that the soul of a man who had just been killed was
          wroth with his slayer and troubled him; wherefore it was needful
          even for the involuntary homicide to depart from his country for a
          year until the anger of the dead man had cooled down; nor might the

          haunted by an angry ghost. When the turbulent people of Cynaetha,
          after perpetrating an atrocious massacre, sent an embassy to
          Sparta, every Arcadian town through which the envoys passed on
          their journey ordered them out of its walls at once; and the
          Mantineans, after the embassy had departed, even instituted a
          solemn purification of the city and its territory by carrying
          sacrificial victims round them both.<a id="noteref_624" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia, men who have partaken of
          human flesh as a ceremonial rite are subject for a long time
          afterwards to many restrictions or taboos of the sort we have been
          dealing with. They may not touch their wives for a whole year; and
          during the same time they are forbidden to work or gamble. For four
          months they must live alone in their bedrooms, and when they are
          obliged to quit the house for a necessary purpose, they may not go
          out at the ordinary door, but must use only the secret door in the
          rear of the house. On such occasions each of them is attended by
          all the rest, carrying small sticks. They must all sit down
          together on a long log, then get up, then sit down again, repeating
          this three <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg
          189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          times before they are allowed to remain seated. Before they rise
          they must turn round four times. Then they go back to the house.
          Before entering they must raise their feet four times; with the
          fourth step they really pass the door, taking care to enter with
          the right foot foremost. In the doorway they turn four times and
          walk slowly into the house. They are not permitted to look back.
          During the four months of their seclusion each man in eating must
          use a spoon, dish, and kettle of his own, which are thrown away at
          the end of the period. Before he draws water from a bucket or a
          brook, he must dip his cup into it thrice; and he may not take more
          than four mouthfuls at one time. He must carry a wing-bone of an
          eagle and drink through it, for his lips may not touch the brim of
          his cup. Also he keeps a copper nail to scratch his head with, for
          were his own nails to touch his own skin they would drop off. For
          sixteen days after he has partaken of human flesh he may not eat
          any warm food, and for the whole of the four months he is forbidden
          to cool hot food by blowing on it with his breath. At the end of
          winter, when the season of ceremonies is over, he feigns to have
          forgotten the ordinary ways of men, and has to learn everything
          anew. The reason for these remarkable restrictions imposed on men
          who have eaten human flesh is not stated; but we may surmise that
          fear of the ghost of the man whose body was eaten has at least a
          good deal to do with them. We are confirmed in our conjecture by
          observing that though these cannibals sometimes content themselves
          with taking bites out of living people, the rules in question are
          especially obligatory on them after they have devoured a corpse.
          Moreover, the careful treatment of the bones of the victim points
          to the same conclusion; for during the four months of seclusion
          observed by the cannibals, the bones of the person on whom they
          feasted are kept alternately for four days at a time under rocks in
          the sea and in their bedrooms on the north side of the house, where
          the sun cannot shine on them. Finally the bones are taken out of
          the house, tied up, weighted with a stone, and thrown into deep
          water, <span class="tei tei-q">“because it is believed that if they

          Guinea, are much afraid of the spirit of a slain man or woman.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In savage
          society the hunter and the fisherman have often to observe rules of
          abstinence and to submit to ceremonies of purification of the same
          sort as those which are obligatory on the warrior and the
          manslayer; and though we cannot in all cases perceive the exact
          purpose which these rules and ceremonies are supposed to serve, we
          may with some probability assume that, just as the dread of the
          spirits of his enemies is the main motive for the seclusion and
          purification of the warrior who hopes to take or has already taken
          their lives, so the huntsman or fisherman who complies with similar
          customs is principally actuated by a fear of the spirits of the
          beasts, birds, or fish which he has killed or intends to kill. For
          the savage commonly conceives animals to be endowed with souls and
          intelligences like his own, and hence he naturally treats them with
          similar respect. Just as he attempts to appease the ghosts of the
          men he has slain, so he essays to propitiate the spirits of the
          animals he has killed. These ceremonies of propitiation will be
          described later on in this work;<a id="noteref_627" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the savage
          respects, more or less, the souls of all animals, he treats with
          particular deference the spirits of such as are either especially
          useful to him or formidable on account of their size, strength, or
          ferocity. Accordingly the hunting and killing of these valuable or
          dangerous beasts are subject to more elaborate rules and ceremonies
          than the slaughter of comparatively useless and insignificant
          creatures. Thus the Indians of Nootka Sound prepared themselves for
          catching whales by observing a fast for a week, during which they
          ate very little, bathed in the water several times a day, sang, and
          rubbed their bodies, limbs, and faces with shells and bushes till
          they looked as if they had been severely torn with briars. They
          were likewise required to abstain from any commerce with their
          women for the like period, this last condition being considered
          indispensable to their success. A chief who failed to catch a whale
          has been known to attribute his failure to a breach of chastity on
          the part of his men.<a id="noteref_628" name="noteref_628" href=

          should be remarked that the conduct thus prescribed as a

          of the same sort are, or were formerly, observed by Malagasy
          whalers. For eight days before they went to sea the crew of a
          whaler used to fast, abstaining from women and liquor, and
          confessing their most secret faults to each other; and if any man
          was found to have sinned deeply he was forbidden to share in the
          expedition.<a id="noteref_630" name="noteref_630" href=

          the island of Kadiak, off the south coast of Alaska, whalers were
          reckoned unclean during the fishing season, and nobody would eat
          out of the same dish with them or even come near them. Yet we are
          told that great respect was paid to them, and that they were
          regarded as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg

          Though it is not expressly said it seems to be implied, and on the
          strength of analogy we may assume, that these Kadiak whalers had to
          remain chaste so long as the whaling season lasted. In the island
          of Mabuiag continence was imposed on the people both before they
          went to hunt the dugong and while the turtles were pairing. The
          turtle-season lasts during parts of October and November; and if at
          that time unmarried persons had sexual intercourse with each other,
          it was believed that when the canoe approached the floating turtle,
          the male would separate from the female and both would dive down in
          different directions.<a id="noteref_632" name="noteref_632" href=

          preparations for fishing turtle and dugong are most elaborate. They
          begin two months before the fishing. A headman is appointed who
          becomes holy. On his strict observance of the laws of the dugong
          net depends the success of the season. While the men of the village
          are making the nets, this sanctified leader lives entirely secluded
          from his family, and may only eat a roasted banana or two after the
          sun has gone down. Every evening at sundown he goes ashore and,
          stripping himself of all his ornaments, which he is never allowed
          to doff at other times, bathes near where the dugongs feed; as he
          does so he throws scraped coco-nut and scented herbs and gums into
          the water to charm the dugong.<a id="noteref_635" name=

          plying his craft lies under a most strict taboo during the whole of
          the fishing season, which lasts for six or eight weeks. Whenever he
          is on shore he must spend all his time in the men's clubhouse
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          whatever may he visit his own house or so much as look upon the
          faces of his wife and womenkind. Were he but to steal a glance at
          them, they think that flying fish must inevitably bore out his eyes
          at night. If his wife, mother, or daughter brings any gift for him
          or wishes to talk with him, she must stand down towards the shore
          with her back turned to the men's clubhouse. Then the fisherman may
          go out and speak to her, or with his back turned to her he may
          receive what she has brought him; after which he must return at
          once to his rigorous confinement. Indeed the fishermen may not even
          join in dance and song with the other men of the clubhouse in the
          evening; they must keep to themselves and be silent.<a id=

          puts it in a place which has been carefully plastered with holy
          cow-dung to bring good luck. From that time the owner must be
          careful to avoid ceremonial impurity. He must give up cohabitation
          with his wife; he may not sleep on a bed, nor shave himself, nor
          cut his nails, nor anoint himself with oil, nor eat food cooked
          with butter, nor tell lies, nor do anything else that he deems
          wrong. He vows to Singarmati Devi that if the worms are duly born
          he will make her an offering. When the cocoons open and the worms
          appear, he assembles the women of the house and they sing the same

          his hut or his garden, is tabooed. People may not step over his
          cords or tools, and he himself has to observe a number of
          restrictions. He may not go near his wife or any other woman. He
          eats alone, works alone, sleeps alone. He may not wash, except in
          the lake. He may not eat salt or meat or butter. He may not smear
          any fat on his body. When the line is ready he goes to the god,
          asks his blessing on it, and offers him a pot of beer. In return he
          receives from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg
          195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the deity a stick or bit of wood to fasten to the line, and also
          some medicine of herbs to smoke and blow over the water in order
          that the fish may come to the line and be caught. Then he carries
          the line to the lake. If in going thither he should stumble over a
          stone or a tree-root, he takes it with him, and he does the same
          with any grass-seeds that may stick to his clothes. These stones,
          roots, and seeds he puts on the line, believing that just as he
          stumbled over them and they stuck to him, so the fish will also
          stumble over them and stick to the line. The taboo lasts till he
          has caught his first fish. If his wife has kept the taboo, he eats
          the fish with her; but if she has broken it, she may not partake of
          the fish. After that if he wishes to go in to his wife, he must
          take his line out of the water and place it in a tree or some other
          place of safety; he is then free to be with her. But so long as the
          line is in the water, he must keep apart from women, or the fish
          would at once leave the shore. Any breach of this taboo renders the
          line useless to him. He must sell it and make a new one and offer
          an expiatory offering to the god.<a id="noteref_640" name=

          Again, in Uganda the fisherman offers fish to his canoe, believing
          that if he neglected to make this offering more than twice, his net
          would catch nothing. The fish thus offered to the canoe is eaten by
          the fishermen. But if at the time of emptying the traps there is
          any man in the canoe who has committed adultery, eaten flesh or
          salt, or rubbed his body with butter or fat, that man is not
          allowed to partake of the fish offered to the canoe. And if the
          sinner has not confessed his fault to the priest and been purified,
          the catch will be small. When the adulterer has confessed his sin,
          the priest calls the husband of the guilty woman and tells him of
          her crime. Her paramour has to wear a sign to shew that he is doing
          penance, and he makes a feast for the injured husband, which the
          latter is obliged to accept in token of reconciliation. After that
          the husband may not punish either of the erring couple; the sin is
          atoned for and they are able to catch fish again.<a id=

          must observe strict continence, and the restriction lasts until the

          observing strict chastity as a condition of success in hunting and
          fishing is very common among rude races; and the instances of it
          which have been cited render it probable that the rule is always
          based on a superstition rather than on a consideration of the
          temporary weakness which a breach of the custom may entail on the
          hunter or fisherman. In general it appears to be supposed that the

          that, for some reason or other, it offends the animals, who in

          using a cup of their own, which no one else might touch. Hunters

          autumn or early winter a few families of the Hidatsa Indians seek
          some quiet spot in the forest and pitch their camp there to catch
          eagles. After setting up their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> tents they build a small medicine-lodge,
          where the ceremonies supposed to be indispensable for trapping the
          eagles are performed. No woman may enter it. The traps are set on
          high places among the neighbouring hills. When some of the men wish
          to take part in the trapping, they fast and then go by day to the
          medicine-lodge. There they continue without food until about
          midnight, when they partake of a little nourishment and fall
          asleep. They get up just before dawn, or when the morning-star has
          risen, and go to their traps. There they sit all day without food
          or drink, watching for their prey, and struggling, it may be, from
          time to time with a captive eagle, for they always take the birds
          alive. They return to the camp at sunset. As they approach, every
          one rushes into his tent; for the hunter may neither see nor be
          seen by any of his fellow-hunters until he enters the
          medicine-lodge. They spend the night in the lodge, and about
          midnight eat and drink for the first time since the previous
          midnight; then they lie down to sleep, only to rise again before
          dawn and repair anew to the traps. If any one of them has caught
          nothing during the day, he may not sleep at night, but must spend
          his time in loud lamentation and prayer. This routine has to be
          observed by each hunter for four days and four nights, after which
          he returns to his own tent, hungry, thirsty, and tired, and follows
          his ordinary pursuits till he feels able to go again to the
          eagle-traps. During the four days of the trapping he sees none of
          his family, and speaks to none of his friends except those who are
          engaged in the trapping at the same time. They believe that if any
          hunter fails to perform all these rites, the captive eagle will get
          one of his claws loose and tear his captor's hands. There are men
          in the tribe who have had their hands crippled for life in that
          way.<a id="noteref_655" name="noteref_655" href=

          obvious that the severe fasting coupled with the short sleep, or
          even the total sleeplessness, of these eagle-hunters can only
          impair their physical vigour and so far tend to incapacitate them
          for capturing the eagles. The motive of their behaviour in
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name=

          purely superstitious, not rational, and so, we may safely conclude,
          is the custom which simultaneously cuts them off from all
          intercourse with their wives and families.</p>

          the couple to commit a breach of chastity, not only would the wine

          Wandorobbo, a tribe of the same region as the Masai, believe that
          the mere presence of a woman in the neighbourhood of a man who is
          brewing poison would deprive the poison of its venom, and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name=
          "Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that the same thing
          would happen if the wife of the poison-maker were to commit
          adultery while her husband was brewing the poison.<a id=

          this last case it is obvious that a rationalistic explanation of
          the taboo is impossible. How could the loss of virtue in the poison
          be a physical consequence of the loss of virtue in the
          poison-maker's wife? Clearly the effect which the wife's adultery
          is supposed to have on the poison is a case of sympathetic magic;
          her misconduct sympathetically affects her husband and his work at
          a distance. We may, accordingly, infer with some confidence that
          the rule of continence imposed on the poison-maker himself is also
          a simple case of sympathetic magic, and not, as a civilised reader
          might be disposed to conjecture, a wise precaution designed to
          prevent him from accidentally poisoning his wife. Again, to take
          other instances, in the East Indian island of Buru people smear
          their bodies with coco-nut oil as a protection against demons. But
          in order that the charm may be effective, the oil must have been
          made by young unmarried girls.<a id="noteref_660" name=

          the Seranglao and Gorong archipelagoes the same oil is regarded as
          an antidote to poison; but it only possesses this virtue if the
          nuts have been gathered on a Friday by a youth who has never known
          a woman, and if the oil has been extracted by a pure maiden, while
          a priest recited the appropriate spells.<a id="noteref_661" name=

          the Marquesas Islands, when a woman was making coco-nut oil, she
          was tabooed for four or five or more days, during which she might
          have no intercourse with her husband. If she broke this rule, it
          was believed that she would obtain no oil.<a id="noteref_662" name=

          on the work, has to stay all the time in a wretched hovel of straw,
          taking no part in the labour, and observing the strictest

          menstrual pollution. Every year at the end of September or the
          beginning of October, when the north-east monsoon is near an end, a
          fleet of large sailing canoes leaves Port Moresby and the
          neighbouring Motu villages of New Guinea on a trading voyage to the
          deltas of the rivers which flow into the Papuan Gulf. The canoes
          are laden with a cargo of earthenware pots, and after about three
          months they return, sailing before the north-west monsoon and
          bringing back a cargo of sago which they have obtained by barter
          for their crockery. It is about the beginning of the south-east
          monsoon, that is, in April or May, that the skippers, who are
          leading men in the villages, make up their minds to go on these
          trading voyages. When their resolution is taken they communicate it
          to their wives, and from about that time husband and wife cease to
          cohabit. The same custom of conjugal separation is observed by what
          we may call the mate or second in command of each vessel. But it is
          not till the month of August that the work of preparing the canoes
          for sea by overhauling and caulking them is taken seriously in
          hand. From that time both skipper and mate become particularly
          sacred or taboo (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">helaga</span></span>), and consequently they
          keep apart from their wives more than ever. Husband and wife,
          indeed, sleep in the same house but on opposite sides of it. In
          speaking of his wife he calls her <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“maiden,”</span> and she calls him <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“youth.”</span> They have no direct conversation or
          dealings with each other. If he wishes to communicate with her, he
          does so through a third person, usually a relative of one of them.
          Both refrain from washing themselves, and he from combing his hair.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The wife's position indeed becomes very
          much like that of a widow.”</span> When the canoe has been
          launched, skipper, mate, and crew are all forbidden to touch their
          food with their fingers; they must always handle it and convey it
          to their mouths with a bone fork.<a id="noteref_669" name=

          briefer account of the custom and superstition had previously been
          given by a native pastor settled in the neighbourhood of Port
          Moresby. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg

          He says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Here is a custom of
          trading-voyage parties:—If it is arranged to go westward, to
          procure arrowroot, the leader of the party sleeps apart from his
          wife for the time being, and on until the return from the
          expedition, which is sometimes a term of five months. They say if
          this is not done the canoe of the chief will be sunk on the return
          voyage, all the arrowroot lost in the sea, and he himself covered
          with shame. He, however, who observes the rule of self-denial,
          returns laden with arrowroot, has not a drop of salt water to
          injure his cargo, and so is praised by his companions and
          crew.”</span><a id="noteref_670" name="noteref_670" href=

          Akamba and Akikuyu of eastern Africa refrain from the commerce of
          the sexes on a journey, even if their wives are with them in the
          caravan; and they observe the same rule of chastity so long as the
          cattle are at pasture, that is, from the time the herds are driven
          out to graze in the morning till they come back in the
          evening.<a id="noteref_671" name="noteref_671" href=

          the rule should be in force just while the cattle are at pasture is
          not said, but we may conjecture that any act of incontinence at
          that time is somehow supposed, on the principles of sympathetic
          magic, to affect the animals injuriously. The conjecture is
          confirmed by the observation that among the Akikuyu for eight days
          after the quarterly festivals, which they hold for the sake of
          securing God's blessing on their flocks and herds, no commerce is
          permitted between the sexes. They think that any breach of
          continence in these eight days would be followed by a mortality
          among the flocks.<a id="noteref_672" name="noteref_672" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the taboos or
          abstinences observed by hunters and fishermen before and during the
          chase are dictated, as we have seen reason to believe, by
          superstitious motives, and chiefly by a dread of offending or
          frightening the spirits of the creatures whom it is proposed to
          kill, we may expect that the restraints imposed after the slaughter
          has been perpetrated will be at least as stringent, the slayer and
          his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name=

          the added fear of the angry ghosts of his victims before their
          eyes. Whereas on the hypothesis that the abstinences in question,
          including those from food, drink, and sleep, are merely salutary
          precautions for maintaining the men in health and strength to do
          their work, it is obvious that the observance of these abstinences
          or taboos after the work is done, that is, when the game is killed
          and the fish caught, must be wholly superfluous, absurd, and
          inexplicable. But as I shall now shew, these taboos often continue
          to be enforced or even increased in stringency after the death of
          the animals, in other words, after the hunter or fisher has
          accomplished his object by making his bag or landing his fish. The
          rationalistic theory of them therefore breaks down entirely; the
          hypothesis of superstition is clearly the only one open to us.</p>

          Hence the Unalit hunter who has had a hand in the killing of a

          allowed to do any work for the next four days, that being the time
          during which the shade or ghost of the whale is supposed to stay
          with its body. At the same time no one in the village may use any
          sharp or pointed instrument for fear of wounding the whale's shade,
          which is believed to be hovering invisible in the neighbourhood;
          and no loud noise may be made lest it should frighten or offend the
          ghost. Whoever cuts a whale's body with an iron axe will die.
          Indeed the use of all iron instruments is forbidden in the village
          during these four days. These Inuit have a special name
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          considered unclean, and to go upon it would bring misfortune to the
          offender, producing sickness, death, or lack of success in hunting
          or fishing. The same term is also applied to ground where certain
          animals have been killed or have died.”</span> In <span class=

          to be dangerous only to him who there performs some forbidden act.
          For example, the shore where a dead white whale has been beached is
          so regarded. At such a place and time to chop wood with an iron axe
          is supposed to be fatal to the imprudent person who chops. Death,
          too, is supposed to result from cutting wood with an iron axe where
          salmon are being dressed. An old man at St. Michael told Mr. Nelson
          of a melancholy case of this kind which had fallen within the scope
          of his own observation. A man began to chop a log near a woman who
          was splitting salmon: both of them died soon afterwards. The reason
          of this disaster, as the old man explained, was that the shade or
          ghost (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">inua</span></span>) of the salmon and the
          spirit or mystery (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">yu-a</span></span>) of the ground were
          incensed at the proceeding. Such offences are indeed fatal to every
          person who may be present at the desecrated spot. Dogs are regarded
          as very unclean and offensive to the shades of game animals, and
          great care is taken that no dog shall get at the bones of a white
          whale. Should a dog touch one of them, the hunter might lose his
          luck; his nets would break or be shunned by the whales, and his
          spears would not strike. But in addition to the state of
          uncleanness or taboo which arises from the presence of the shades
          of men or animals, these Esquimaux believe in uncleanness of
          another sort which, though not so serious, nevertheless produces
          sickness or bad luck in hunting. It consists, we are told, of a
          kind of invisible, impalpable vapour, which may attach itself to a
          person from some contamination. A hunter infected by such a vapour
          is much more than usually visible to game, so that his luck in the
          chase is gone until he succeeds in cleansing himself once more.
          That is why hunters must avoid menstruous women; if they do not,
          they will be unable to catch game.<a id="noteref_673" name=

          animals would be offended.<a id="noteref_674" name="noteref_674"

          Similarly among the Aleuts of Alaska the hunter who had struck a
          whale with a charmed spear would not throw again, but returned at
          once to his home and separated himself from his people in a hut
          specially constructed for the purpose, where he stayed for three
          days without food or drink, and without touching or looking upon a
          woman. During this time of seclusion he snorted occasionally in
          imitation of the wounded and dying whale, in order to prevent the
          whale which he had struck from leaving the coast. On the fourth day
          he emerged from his seclusion and bathed in the sea, shrieking in a
          hoarse voice and beating the water with his hands. Then, taking
          with him a companion, he repaired to that part of the shore where
          he expected to find the whale stranded. If the beast was dead he at
          once cut out the place where the death-wound had been inflicted. If
          the whale was not dead, he again returned to his home and continued
          washing himself until the whale died.<a id="noteref_675" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">675</span></span></a> Here
          the hunter's imitation of the wounded whale is probably intended by
          means of homoeopathic magic to make the beast die in earnest. Among
          the Kaniagmuts of Alaska the men who attacked the whale were
          considered by their countrymen as unclean during the fishing
          season, though otherwise they were held in high honour.<a id=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The central
          Esquimaux of Baffin Land and Hudson Bay think that whales, ground
          seals, and common seals originated in the severed fingers of the
          goddess Sedna. Hence an Esquimau of these regions must make
          atonement for each of these animals that he kills, and must observe
          strictly certain taboos after their slaughter. Some of the rules of
          conduct thus enjoined are identical with those which are in force
          after the death of a human being. Thus after the killing of one of
          these sea-mammals, as after the decease of a person, it is
          forbidden to scrape the frost from the window, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to shake the bed or to disturb the
          shrubs under the bed, to remove the drippings of oil from under the
          lamp, to scrape hair from skins, to cut snow for the purpose of
          melting it, to work on iron, wood, stone, or ivory. Furthermore,
          women are forbidden to comb their hair, to wash their faces, and to
          dry their boots and stockings. All these regulations must be kept
          with the greatest care after a ground seal has been killed, because
          the transgression of taboos that refer to this animal makes the
          hands of Sedna very sore. When a seal is brought into the hut, the
          women must stop working until it is cut up. After the capture of a
          ground seal, walrus, or whale, they must rest for three days. Not
          all kinds of work, however, are forbidden; they may mend articles
          made of sealskin, but they may not make anything new. Working on
          the new skins of caribou, the American reindeer, is strictly
          prohibited; for a series of rules forbids all contact between that
          animal and the sea-mammals. Thus reindeer-skins obtained in summer
          may not be prepared before the ice has formed and the first seal is
          caught with the harpoon. Later, as soon as the first walrus has
          been killed, the work must stop again until the next autumn. Hence
          everybody is eager to have his reindeer-skins ready as quickly as
          possible, for until that is done the walrus season will not begin.
          When the first walrus has been killed a messenger goes from village
          to village and announces the news, whereupon all work on
          reindeer-skins immediately ceases. On the other hand, when the
          season for hunting the reindeer begins, all the winter clothing and
          the winter tents that had been in use during the walrus hunting
          season become tabooed and are buried under stones; they may not be
          used again till the next walrus hunting season comes round. No
          walrus-hide or thongs made of such hide may be taken inland, where
          the reindeer live. Venison may not be put in the same boat with
          walrus-meat, nor yet with salmon. If venison or the antlers of the
          reindeer were in a boat which goes walrus-hunting, the boat would
          be liable to be broken by the walrus. The Esquimaux are not allowed
          to eat venison and walrus on the same day, unless they first strip
          naked or put on clothing of reindeer-skin that has never been worn
          in hunting walrus. The transgression of these taboos gives umbrage
          to the souls of walrus; and a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> myth is told to account for the mutual
          aversion of the walrus and the reindeer. And in general the
          Esquimaux say that Sedna dislikes the reindeer, wherefore they may
          not bring the beast into contact with her favourites, the
          sea-mammals. Hence the meat of the whale and the seal, as well as
          of the walrus, may not be eaten on the same day with venison. It is
          not permitted that both sorts of meat lie on the floor of the hut
          or behind the lamps at the same time. If a man who has eaten
          venison in the morning happens to enter a hut in which seal meat is
          being cooked, he is allowed to eat venison on the bed, but it must
          be wrapped up before it is carried into the hut, and he must take
          care to keep clear of the floor. Before they change from one food
          to the other the Esquimaux must wash themselves.</p>

          the sea-beasts themselves there are rules of mutual avoidance which
          these central Esquimaux must observe. Thus a person who has been
          eating or hunting walrus must strip naked or change his clothes
          before he eats seal; otherwise the transgression will become
          fastened to the soul of the walrus in a manner which will be
          explained presently. Again, the soul of a salmon is very powerful,
          and its body may not be eaten on the same day with walrus or
          venison. Salmon may not be cooked in a pot that has been used to
          boil any other kind of meat; and it must always be cooked at some
          distance from the hut. The salmon-fisher is not allowed to wear
          boots that have been used in hunting walrus; and no work may be
          done on boot-legs till the first salmon has been caught and put on
          a boot-leg. Once more the soul of the grim polar bear is offended
          if the taboos which concern him are not observed. His soul tarries
          for three days near the spot where it left his body, and during
          these days the Esquimaux are particularly careful to conform
          rigidly to the laws of taboo, because they believe that punishment
          overtakes the transgressor who sins against the soul of a bear far
          more speedily than him who sins against the souls of the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The goddess
          Sedna, he tells us, the mother of the sea-mammals, may be
          considered to be the chief deity of the central Esquimaux. She is
          supposed to bear supreme sway over the destinies of mankind, and
          almost all the observances of these tribes have for their object to
          retain her good will or appease her anger. Her home is in the lower
          world, where she dwells in a house built of stone and whale-ribs.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The souls of seals, ground seals, and
          whales are believed to proceed from her house. After one of these
          animals has been killed, its soul stays with the body for three
          days. Then it goes back to Sedna's abode, to be sent forth again by
          her. If, during the three days that the soul stays with the body,
          any taboo or proscribed custom is violated, the violation
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pitssēte</span></span>) becomes attached to
          the animal's soul, and causes it pain. The soul strives in vain to
          free itself of these attachments, but is compelled to take them
          down to Sedna. The attachments, in some manner not explained, make
          her hands sore, and she punishes the people who are the cause of
          her pains by sending to them sickness, bad weather, and starvation.
          If, on the other hand, all taboos have been observed, the
          sea-animals will allow themselves to be caught; they will even come
          to meet the hunter. The object of the innumerable taboos that are
          in force after the killing of these sea-animals, therefore, is to
          keep their souls free from attachments that would hurt their souls
          as well as Sedna.</span></p>

          This vapour and the dark colour of death are exceedingly unpleasant

          particularly with menstruating women or with those who have

          bleeding should allow others to come in contact with him, he would
          cause them to become distasteful to the seals, and therefore to
          Sedna as well. For this reason custom demands that every person
          must at once announce if he has touched a body, and that women must
          make known when they are menstruating or when they have had a
          miscarriage. If they do not do so, they will bring ill-luck to all

          transgression of a taboo, in order to protect the community from

              <span style="font-size: 80%">In the system of taboos of the
              central Esquimaux we see animism passing into religion;
              morality is coming to rest on a supernatural basis, namely the
              will of the goddess Sedna. In this evolution of religion the
              practice of confession has played a part. It seems to have been
              regarded as a spiritual purge or emetic, by which sin,
              conceived as a sort of morbid substance, was expelled from the
              body of the sinner.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
          elaborate taboos so well described by Dr. Boas we seem to see a
          system of animism in the act of passing into religion. The rules
          themselves bear the clearest traces of having originated in a
          doctrine of souls, and of being determined by the supposed likes
          and dislikes, sympathies and antipathies of the various classes of
          spirits toward each other. But above and behind the souls of men
          and animals has grown up the overshadowing conception of a powerful
          goddess who rules them all, so that the taboos come more and more
          to be viewed as a means of propitiating her rather than as merely
          adapted to suit the tastes of the souls themselves. Thus the
          standard of conduct is shifted from a natural to a supernatural
          basis: the supposed wish of the deity or, as we commonly put it,
          the will of God, tends to supersede <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the wishes, real or imaginative, of purely
          natural beings as the measure of right and wrong. The old savage
          taboos, resting on a theory of the direct relations of living
          creatures to each other, remain in substance unchanged, but they
          are outwardly transformed into ethical precepts with a religious or
          supernatural sanction. In this gradual passage of a rude philosophy
          into an elementary religion the place occupied by confession as a
          moral purgative is particularly interesting. I can hardly agree
          with Dr. Boas that among these Esquimaux the confession of sins was
          in its origin no more than a means of warning others against the
          dangerous contagion of the sinner; in other words, that its saving
          efficacy consisted merely in preventing the innocent from suffering
          with the guilty, and that it had no healing virtue, no purifying
          influence, for the evil-doer himself. It seems more probable that
          originally the violation of taboo, in other words, the sin, was
          conceived as something almost physical, a sort of morbid substance
          lurking in the sinner's body, from which it could be expelled by
          confession as by a sort of spiritual purge or emetic. This is
          confirmed by the form of auricular confession which is practised by
          the Akikuyu of British East Africa. Amongst them, we are told,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“sin is essentially remissable; it suffices
          to confess it. Usually this is done to the sorcerer, who expels the
          sin by a ceremony of which the principal rite is a pretended
          emetic: <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kotahikio</span></span>, derived from
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">681</span></span></a> Thus
          among these savages the confession and absolution of sins is, so to
          say, a purely physical process of relieving a sufferer of a burden
          which sits heavy on his stomach rather than on his conscience. This
          view of the matter is again confirmed by the observation that these
          same Akikuyu resort to another physical mode of expelling sin from
          a sinner, and that is by the employment of a scapegoat, which by
          them, as by the Jews and many other people, has been employed as a
          vehicle for carting away moral rubbish and dumping it somewhere
          else. For example, if a Kikuyu man has committed incest, which
          would naturally entail his death, he produces a substitute in the
          shape of a he-goat, to which by an ignoble ceremony <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he transfers his guilt. Then the throat
          of the animal is cut, and the human culprit is thereby purged of
          his sin.<a id="noteref_682" name="noteref_682" href=

            <div class="tei tei-marginnotetext">
              <span style="font-size: 80%">Hence the confession of sins is
              employed as a sort of medicine for the recovery of the sick.
              Similarly the confession of sins is sometimes resorted to by
              women in hard labour as a means of accelerating their delivery.
              In these cases confession is a magical ceremony designed to
              relieve the sinner.</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence we may
          suspect that the primary motive of the confession of sins among
          savages was self-regarding; in other words, the intention was
          rather to benefit the sinner himself than to safeguard others by
          warning them of the danger they would incur by coming into contact
          with him. This view is borne out by the observation that confession
          is sometimes used as a means of healing the sick transgressor
          himself, who is supposed to recover as soon as he has made a clean
          breast of his transgression. Thus <span class="tei tei-q">“when the
          Carriers are severely sick, they often think that they shall not
          recover, unless they divulge to a priest or magician every crime
          which they may have committed, which has hitherto been kept secret.
          In such a case they will make a full confession, and then they
          expect that their lives will be spared for a time longer. But
          should they keep back a single crime, they as firmly believe that
          they shall suffer almost instant death.”</span><a id="noteref_683"

          Again, the Aurohuaca Indians, who, under the tropical sun of South
          America, inhabit a chilly region bordering on the perpetual snows
          of the Sierra Nevada in Colombia, believe that all sickness is a
          punishment for sin. So when one of their medicine-men is summoned
          to a sick bed, he does not enquire after the patient's symptoms but
          makes strange passes over him and asks in a sepulchral voice
          whether he will confess his sins. If the sick man persists in
          drawing a veil of silence over his frailties, the doctor will not
          attempt to treat him, but will turn on his heel and leave the
          house. On the other hand if a satisfactory confession has been
          made, the leech directs the patient's friends to procure certain
          odd-looking bits of stone or shell to which the sins of the
          sufferer may be transferred, for when that is done he will be made
          whole. For this purpose the sin-laden stones or shells are carried
          high up into the mountains and laid in some spot <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> where the first beams of the sun,
          rising in clear or clouded majesty above the long white slopes or
          the towering crags of the Sierra Nevada, will strike down on them,
          driving sin and sickness far away by their radiant influence.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">684</span></span></a> Here,
          again, we see that sin is regarded as something almost material
          which by confession can be removed from the body of the patient and
          laid on stones or shells. Further, the confession of sins has been
          resorted to by some people as a means of accelerating the birth of
          a child when the mother was in hard labour. Thus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“among the Indians of Guatemala, in the time of their
          idolatry when a woman was in labour, the midwife ordered her to
          confess her sins; and if she was not delivered, the husband was to
          confess his; and if that did not do they took off his clouts and
          put them about his wife's loins; if still she could not be
          delivered, the midwife drew blood from herself and sprinkled it
          towards the four quarters of heaven with some invocations and
          ceremonies.”</span><a id="noteref_685" name="noteref_685" href=
          "#note_685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">685</span></span></a> In
          these attempts of the Indians to accelerate the birth of the child
          it seems clear that the confession of sins on the part first of the
          wife and afterwards of the husband is nothing but a magical
          ceremony like the putting of the husband's clothes on the suffering
          woman<a id="noteref_686" name="noteref_686" href=
          "#note_686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">686</span></span></a> or
          the sprinkling of the midwife's blood towards the four quarters of
          the heaven. Amongst the Antambahoaka, a savage tribe of Madagascar,
          when a woman is in hard labour, a sorcerer is called in to her aid.
          After <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name=
          "Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> making some magical
          signs and uttering some incantations, he generally declares that
          the patient cannot be delivered until she has publicly confessed a
          secret fault which she has committed. In such a case a woman has
          been known to confess to incest with her brother; and immediately
          after her confession the child was born.<a id="noteref_687" name=
          "noteref_687" href="#note_687"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a> In
          these cases the confession of sins is clearly not a mode of warning
          people to keep clear of the sinner; it is a magical ceremony
          primarily intended to benefit the sinner himself or herself and no
          other. The same thing may perhaps be said of a confession which was
          prescribed in a certain case by ancient Hindoo ritual. At a great
          festival of Varuna, which fell at the beginning of the rainy
          season, the priest asked the wife of the sacrificer to name her
          paramour or paramours, and she had to mention their names or at
          least to take up as many grass-stalks as she had lovers.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Now when a woman who belongs to one man
          carries on intercourse with another, she undoubtedly commits a sin
          against Varuna. He therefore thus asks her, lest she should
          sacrifice with a secret pang in her mind; for when confessed the
          sin becomes less, since it becomes truth; this is why he thus asks
          her. And whatever connection she confesses not, that indeed will
          turn out injurious to her relatives.”</span><a id="noteref_689"
          name="noteref_689" href="#note_689"><span class=

          sin is said to diminish the sin, just as if the mere utterance of
          the words ejected or expelled some morbid matter from the person of
          the sinner, thereby relieving her of its burden and benefiting also
          her relatives, who would suffer through any sin which she might not
          have confessed.</p>

              <span style="font-size: 80%">Thus the confession of sins is at
              first rather a bodily than a moral purgation, resembling the
              ceremonies of washing, fumigation, and so on, which are

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus at an early
          stage of culture the confession of sins wears the aspect of a
          bodily rather than of a moral and spiritual purgation; it is a
          magical rather than a religious rite, and as such it resembles the
          ceremonies of washing, scouring, fumigation, and so forth, which in
          like manner are applied by many primitive peoples to the
          purification of what we should regard as moral guilt, but what they
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name=
          "Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> consider rather as a
          corporeal pollution or infection, which can be removed by the
          physical agencies of fire, water, fasts, purgatives, abrasion,
          scarification, and so forth. But when the guilt of sin ceases to be
          regarded as something material, a sort of clinging vapour of death,
          and is conceived as the transgression of the will of a wise and
          good God, it is obvious that the observance of these outward rites
          of purification becomes superfluous and absurd, a vain show which
          cannot appease the anger of the offended deity. The only means of
          turning away his wrath and averting the fatal consequences of sin
          is now believed to be the humble confession and true repentance of
          the sinner. At this stage of ethical evolution the practice of
          confession loses its old magical character as a bodily purge and
          assumes the new aspect of a purely religious rite, the propitiation
          of a great supernatural and moral being, who by a simple fiat can
          cancel the transgression and restore the transgressor to a state of
          pristine innocence. This comfortable doctrine teaches us that in
          order to blot out the effects of our misdeeds we have only to
          acknowledge and confess them with a lowly and penitent heart,
          whereupon a merciful God will graciously pardon our sin and absolve
          us and ours from its consequences. It might indeed be well for the
          world if we could thus easily undo the past, if we could recall the
          words that have been spoken amiss, if we could arrest the long
          train that follows, like a flight of avenging Furies, on every evil
          action. But this we cannot do. Our words and acts, good and bad,
          have their natural, their inevitable consequences. God may pardon
          sin, but Nature cannot.</p>

          masquerading as an expression of the divine will or draped in the
          flowing robes of a false philosophy, have maintained their credit
          long after the crude ideas out of which they sprang have been

          sanctity from the same ancient system of superstition. For example,
          we can hardly doubt that in primitive society the crime of murder
          derived much of its horror from a fear of the angry ghost of the
          murdered man. Thus superstition may serve as a convenient crutch to
          morality till she is strong enough to throw away the crutch and
          walk alone. To judge by the legislation of the Pentateuch the
          ancient Semites appear to have passed through a course of moral
          evolution not unlike that which we can still detect in process
          among the Esquimaux of Baffin Land. Some of the old laws of Israel
          are clearly savage taboos of a familiar type thinly disguised as
          commands of the deity. This disguise is indeed a good deal more
          perfect in Palestine than in Baffin Land, but in substance it is
          the same. Among the Esquimaux it is the will of Sedna; among the

          Amongst the Caffres of South Africa <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          slaughter of a lion, however honourable it is esteemed, is
          nevertheless associated with an idea of moral uncleanness, and is
          followed by a very strange ceremony. When the hunters approach the
          village on their return, the man who gave the lion the first wound
          is hidden from every eye by the shields which his comrades hold up
          before him. One of the hunters steps forward and, leaping and
          bounding in a strange manner, praises the courage of the
          lion-killer. Then he rejoins the band, and the same performance is
          repeated by another. All the rest meanwhile keep up a ceaseless
          shouting, rattling with their clubs on their shields. This goes on
          till they have reached the village. Then a mean hut is run up not
          far from the village; and in this hut the lion-killer, because he
          is unclean, must remain four days, cut off from all association
          with the tribe. There he dyes his body all over with white paint;
          and lads who have not yet been circumcised, and are therefore, in
          respect to uncleanness, in the same state as himself, bring him a
          calf to eat, and wait upon him. When the four days are over, the
          unclean man washes himself, paints himself with red paint in the
          usual manner, and is escorted back to the village by the head
          chief, attended with a guard of honour. Lastly, a second calf is
          killed; and, the uncleanness being now at an end, every one is free
          to eat of the calf with him.”</span><a id="noteref_694" name=

          Similarly the Lapps deem it the height of glory to kill a bear,
          which they consider the king of beasts. Nevertheless, all the men
          who take part in the slaughter are regarded as unclean, and must
          live by themselves for three days in a hut or tent made specially
          for them, where they cut up and cook the bear's carcase. The
          reindeer which brought in the carcase on a sledge may not be driven
          by a woman for a whole year; indeed, according to one account, it
          may not be used by anybody for that period. Before the men go into
          the tent where they are to be secluded, they strip themselves of
          the garments they had worn in killing the bear, and their wives
          spit the red juice of alder bark in their faces. They enter the
          tent not by the ordinary door but by an opening at the back. When
          the bear's flesh has been cooked, a portion of it is sent by the
          hands of two men to the women, who may not approach the men's tent
          while the cooking is going on. The men who convey the flesh to the
          women pretend to be strangers bringing presents from a foreign
          land; the women keep up the pretence and promise to tie red threads
          round the legs of the strangers. The bear's flesh may not be passed
          in to the women through the door of their tent, but must be thrust
          in at a special opening made by lifting up the hem of the
          tent-cover. When the three days' seclusion is over and the men are
          at liberty to return to their wives, they run, one after the other,
          round the fire, holding the chain by which pots are suspended over
          it. This is regarded as a form of purification; they may now leave
          the tent by the ordinary door and rejoin the women. But the leader
          of the party must still abstain from cohabitation with his wife for
          two days more.<a id="noteref_696" name="noteref_696" href=

          water during the day for several weeks together; and no beast
          whatever was allowed to be slaughtered at the hamlet to which he
          belonged, until this duty had been fully performed. The body of the
          snake was then taken and carefully buried in a trench, dug close to
          the cattle-fold, where its remains, like those of a chief, were
          henceforward kept perfectly undisturbed. The period of penance, as

          Amongst the Ewe-speaking peoples of the Slave Coast, who worship
          the python, a native who killed one of these serpents used to be
          burned alive. But for some time past, though a semblance of
          carrying out the old penalty is preserved, the culprit is allowed
          to escape with his life, but he has to pay a heavy fine. A small
          hut of dry faggots and grass is set up, generally near the lagoon
          at Whydah, if the crime has been perpetrated there; the guilty man
          is thrust inside, the door of plaited grass is shut on him, and the
          hut is set on fire. Sometimes a dog, a kid, and two fowls are
          enclosed along with him, and he is drenched with palm-oil and
          yeast, probably to render him the more combustible. As he is
          unbound, he easily breaks out of the frail hut before the flames
          consume him; but he has to run the gauntlet of the angry
          serpent-worshippers, who belabour the murderer of their god with
          sticks and pelt him with clods until he reaches water and plunges
          into it, which is supposed to wash away his sin. Thirteen days
          later a commemoration service is held in honour of the deceased
          python.<a id="noteref_698" name="noteref_698" href=

          Madras it is considered a great sin to kill a cobra. When this has
          happened, the people generally burn the body of the serpent just as
          they burn the bodies of human beings. The murderer deems himself
          polluted for three days. On the second day milk is poured on the
          remains of the cobra. On the third <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these last
          cases the animal whose slaughter has to be atoned for is sacred,
          that is, it is one whose life is commonly spared from motives of
          superstition. Yet the treatment of the sacrilegious slayer seems to
          resemble so closely the treatment of hunters and fishermen who have
          killed animals for food in the ordinary course of business, that
          the ideas on which both sets of customs are based may be assumed to
          be substantially the same. Those ideas, if I am right, are the
          respect which the savage feels for the souls of beasts, especially
          valuable or formidable beasts, and the dread which he entertains of
          their vengeful ghosts. Some confirmation of this view may be drawn
          from the ceremonies observed by fishermen of Annam when the carcase
          of a whale is washed ashore. These fisherfolk, we are told, worship
          the whale on account of the benefits they derive from it. There is
          hardly a village on the sea-shore which has not its small pagoda,
          containing the bones, more or less authentic, of a whale. When a
          dead whale is washed ashore, the people accord it a solemn burial.
          The man who first caught sight of it acts as chief mourner,
          performing the rites which as chief mourner and heir he would
          perform for a human kinsman. He puts on all the garb of woe, the
          straw hat, the white robe with long sleeves turned inside out, and
          the other paraphernalia of full mourning. As next of kin to the
          deceased he presides over the funeral rites. Perfumes are burned,
          sticks of incense kindled, leaves of gold and silver scattered,
          crackers let off. When the flesh has been cut off and the oil
          extracted, the remains of the carcase are buried in the sand.
          Afterwards a shed is set up and offerings are made in it. Usually
          some time after the burial the spirit of the dead whale takes
          possession of some person in the village and declares by his mouth
          whether he is a male or a female.<a id="noteref_700" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in
          primitive society the rules of ceremonial purity observed by divine
          kings, chiefs, and priests agree in many respects with the rules
          observed by homicides, mourners, women in childbed, girls at
          puberty, hunters and fishermen, and so on. To us these various
          classes of persons appear to differ totally in character and
          condition; some of them we should call holy, others we might
          pronounce unclean and polluted. But the savage makes no such moral
          distinction between them; the conceptions of holiness and pollution
          are not yet differentiated in his mind. To him the common feature
          of all these persons is that they are dangerous and in danger, and
          the danger in which they stand and to which they expose others is
          what we should call spiritual or ghostly, and therefore imaginary.
          The danger, however, is not less real because it is imaginary;
          imagination acts upon man as really as does gravitation, and may
          kill him as certainly as a dose of prussic acid. To seclude these
          persons from the rest of the world so that the dreaded spiritual
          danger shall neither reach them, nor spread from them, is the
          object of the taboos which they have to observe. These taboos act,
          so to say, as electrical insulators to preserve the spiritual force
          with which these persons are charged from suffering or inflicting
          harm by contact with the outer world.<a id="noteref_701" name=

          illustrations of these general principles which have been already
          given I shall now add some more, drawing my examples, first, from
          the class of tabooed things, and, second, from the class of tabooed
          words; for in the opinion of the savage both things and words may,
          like persons, be charged or electrified, either temporarily or
          permanently, with the mysterious virtue of taboo, and may therefore
          require to be banished for a longer or shorter time from the
          familiar usage of common life. And the examples will be chosen with
          special reference to those sacred chiefs, kings and priests, who,
          more than anybody else, live fenced about by taboo as by a wall.

          no one may touch the king of Cambodia, for any purpose whatever,
          without his express command. In July 1874 the king was thrown from
          his carriage and lay insensible on the ground, but not one of his

          Formerly no one might touch the king of Corea; and if he deigned to
          touch a subject, the spot touched became sacred, and the person
          thus honoured had to wear a visible mark (generally a cord of red
          silk) for the rest of his life. Above all, no iron might touch the
          king's body. In 1800 King Tieng-tsong-tai-oang died of a tumour in
          the back, no one dreaming of employing the lancet, which would

          years ago a harmless naturalist was collecting plants among the

          the summit of a pass he gazed with delight down a long valley
          which, stretching away as far as eye could reach to the south,
          resembled a sea of bloom, for everywhere the forest was ablaze with
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name=
          "Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> gorgeous hues of the
          rhododendron and azalea in flower. In this earthly paradise the
          votary of science hastened to install himself beside a lake. But
          hardly had he done so when, alas! the weather changed. Though the
          season was early June, the cold became intense, snow fell heavily,
          and the bloom of the rhododendrons was cut off. The inhabitants of
          a neighbouring village at once set down the unusual severity of the
          weather to the presence of a stranger in the forest; and a
          round-robin, signed by them unanimously, was forwarded to the
          nearest mandarin, setting forth that the snow which had blocked the
          road, and the hail which was blasting their crops, were alike
          caused by the intruder, and that all sorts of disturbances would
          follow if he were allowed to remain. In these circumstances the
          naturalist, who had intended to spend most of the summer among the
          mountains, was forced to decamp. <span class=

              <span style="font-size: 80%">The dislike of spirits to iron
              allows men to use the metal as a weapon against them. Iron used
              as a charm against fairies in the Highlands of Scotland. Iron
              used as a protective charm by Scotch fishermen and others. Iron

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
          dislike of innovation, which always makes itself strongly felt in
          the sphere of religion, is sufficient by itself to account for the
          superstitious aversion to iron entertained by kings and priests and
          attributed by them to the gods; possibly this aversion may have
          been intensified in places by some such accidental cause as the
          series of bad seasons which cast discredit on iron ploughshares in
          Poland. But the disfavour in which iron is held by the gods and
          their ministers has another side. Their antipathy to the metal
          furnishes men with a weapon which may be turned against the spirits
          when occasion serves. As their dislike of iron is supposed to be so
          great that they will not approach persons and things protected by
          the obnoxious metal, iron may obviously be employed as a charm for
          banning ghosts and other dangerous spirits. And often it is so
          used. Thus in the Highlands of Scotland the great safeguard against
          the elfin race is iron, or, better yet, steel. The metal in any
          form, whether as a sword, a knife, a gun-barrel, or what not, is
          all-powerful for this purpose. Whenever you enter a fairy
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name=
          "Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dwelling you should
          always remember to stick a piece of steel, such as a knife, a
          needle, or a fish-hook, in the door; for then the elves will not be
          able to shut the door till you come out again. So too when you have
          shot a deer and are bringing it home at night, be sure to thrust a
          knife into the carcase, for that keeps the fairies from laying
          their weight on it. A knife or a nail in your pocket is quite
          enough to prevent the fairies from lifting you up at night. Nails
          in the front of a bed ward off elves from women <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“in the straw”</span> and from their babes; but to make
          quite sure it is better to put the smoothing-iron under the bed,
          and the reaping-hook in the window. If a bull has fallen over a
          rock and been killed, a nail stuck into it will preserve the flesh
          from the fairies. Music discoursed on that melodious instrument, a
          Jew's harp, keeps the elfin women away from the hunter, because the
          tongue of the instrument is of steel.<a id="noteref_741" name=

          Again, when Scotch fishermen were at sea, and one of them happened
          to take the name of God in vain, the first man who heard him called
          out <span class="tei tei-q">“Cauld airn,”</span> at which every man

          the parents sometimes sell the child to the village smith, who
          makes a small ring or circlet of iron and puts it on the child's
          foot, commonly adding a little chain of iron. When the infant has
          been sold to the smith and firmly attached to him by the chain, the
          demons no longer have any power over him. After the child has grown
          big and the danger is over, the parents ask the smith to break the
          iron ring and thank him for his services. No metal but iron will

          the Slave Coast of Africa when a mother sees her child gradually
          wasting away, she concludes that a demon has entered into the child
          and takes her measures accordingly. To lure the demon out of the
          body of her offspring, she offers a sacrifice of food; and while
          the devil is bolting it, she attaches iron rings and small bells to
          her child's ankles and hangs iron chains round his neck. The
          jingling of the iron and the tinkling of the bells are supposed to
          prevent the demon, when he has concluded his repast, from entering
          again into the body of the little sufferer. Hence many children may

          the third, sixth, ninth, and fortieth days after the funeral the
          old Prussians and Lithuanians used to prepare a meal, to which,
          standing at the door, they invited the soul of the deceased. At
          these meals they sat silent round the table and used no knives, and
          the women who served up the food were also without knives. If any
          morsels fell from the table they were left lying there for the
          lonely souls that had no living relations or friends to feed them.

          doubtless in order that they may not hurt the tender soul of the
          new-born child. Early in the period of the Ming dynasty a professor
          of geomancy made the alarming discovery that the spiritual
          atmosphere of Kü-yung, a city near Nanking, was in a truly
          deplorable condition through the intrusion of an evil spirit. The
          Chinese emperor, with paternal solicitude, directed that the north
          gate, by which the devil had effected his entrance, should be built
          up solid, and that for the future the population of the city should
          devote their energies to the pursuits of hair-dressing,
          corn-cutting, and the shaving of bamboo-roots, because, as he
          sagaciously perceived, all these professions call for the use of
          sharp-edged instruments, which could not fail to keep the demon at

          can now understand why no cutting instrument may be taken into the
          house of the Burmese pontiff. Like so many priestly kings, he is
          probably regarded as divine, and it is therefore right that his
          sacred spirit should not be exposed to the risk of being cut or
          wounded whenever it quits his body to hover invisible in the air or
          to fly on some distant mission.</p>

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">776</span></span></a> The
          taboo is probably based on the common belief that the soul or
          spirit of the animal is in the blood. As tabooed persons are
          believed to be in a perilous state—for example, the relations of
          the slain man are liable to the attacks of his indignant ghost—it
          is especially necessary to isolate them from contact with spirits;
          hence the prohibition to touch raw meat. But as usual the taboo is
          only the special enforcement of a general precept; in other words,
          its observance is particularly enjoined in circumstances which seem
          urgently to call for its application, but apart from such
          circumstances the prohibition is also observed, though less
          strictly, as a common rule of life. Thus some of the Esthonians
          will not taste blood because they believe that it contains the
          animal's soul, which would enter the body of the person who tasted
          the blood.<a id="noteref_777" name="noteref_777" href=

          a party of natives having come to visit a chief in a fine new
          canoe, the chief got into it, but in doing so a splinter entered
          his foot, and the blood trickled on the canoe, which at once became
          sacred to him. The owner jumped out, dragged the canoe ashore
          opposite the chief's house, and left it there. Again, a chief in
          entering a missionary's house knocked his head against a beam, and
          the blood flowed. The natives said that in former times the house

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen
          that the Flamen Dialis was not allowed to walk under a trellised
          vine.<a id="noteref_830" name="noteref_830" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">830</span></span></a> The
          reason for this prohibition was perhaps as follows. It has been
          shewn that plants are considered as animate beings which bleed when
          cut, the red juice which exudes from some of them being regarded as
          the blood of the plant.<a id="noteref_831" name="noteref_831" href=
          "#note_831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a> The
          juice of the grape is therefore naturally conceived as the blood of
          the vine.<a id="noteref_832" name="noteref_832" href=
          "#note_832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a> And
          since, as we have just seen, the soul is often believed to be in
          the blood, the juice of the grape is regarded as the soul, or as
          containing the soul, of the vine. This belief is strengthened by
          the intoxicating effects of wine. For, according to primitive
          notions, all abnormal mental states, such as intoxication or
          madness, are caused by the entrance of a spirit into the person;
          such mental states, in other words, are accounted forms of
          possession or inspiration. Wine, therefore, is considered on two
          distinct grounds as a spirit, or containing a spirit; first
          because, as a red juice, it is identified with the blood of the
          plant, and second because it intoxicates or inspires. Therefore if
          the Flamen Dialis had walked under a trellised vine, the spirit of
          the vine, embodied in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg
          249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          clusters of grapes, would have been immediately over his head and
          might have touched it, which for a person like him in a state of
          permanent taboo<a id="noteref_833" name="noteref_833" href=
          "#note_833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a> would
          have been highly dangerous. This interpretation of the prohibition
          will be made probable if we can shew, first, that wine has been
          actually viewed by some peoples as blood, and intoxication as
          inspiration produced by drinking the blood; and, second, that it is
          often considered dangerous, especially for tabooed persons, to have
          either blood or a living person over their heads.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to
          the first point, we are informed by Plutarch that of old the
          Egyptian kings neither drank wine nor offered it in libations to
          the gods, because they held it to be the blood of beings who had
          once fought against the gods, the vine having sprung from their
          rotting bodies; and the frenzy of intoxication was explained by the
          supposition that the drunken man was filled with the blood of the
          enemies of the gods.<a id="noteref_834" name="noteref_834" href=
          "#note_834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">834</span></span></a> The
          Aztecs regarded <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pulque</span></span> or the wine of the
          country as bad, on account of the wild deeds which men did under
          its influence. But these wild deeds were believed to be the acts,
          not of the drunken man, but of the wine-god by whom he was
          possessed and inspired; and so seriously was this theory of
          inspiration held that if any one spoke ill of or insulted a tipsy
          man, he was liable to be punished for disrespect to the wine-god
          incarnate in his votary. Hence, says Sahagun, it was believed, not
          without ground, that the Indians intoxicated themselves on purpose
          to commit with impunity crimes for which they would certainly have
          been punished if they had committed them <span class="tei tei-pb"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">835</span></span></a> Thus
          it appears that on the primitive view intoxication or the
          inspiration produced by wine is exactly parallel to the inspiration
          produced by drinking the blood of animals.<a id="noteref_836" name=

          soul or life is in the blood, and wine is the blood of the vine.
          Hence whoever drinks the blood of an animal is inspired with the
          soul of the animal or of the god, who, as we have seen,<a id=

          often supposed to enter into the animal before it is slain; and
          whoever drinks wine drinks the blood, and so receives into himself
          the soul or spirit, of the god of the vine.</p>

          The reason they give is that a woman may have been upon the tree or

          women's blood, is a fear that they may come in contact with the
          head; for among many peoples the head is peculiarly sacred. The
          special sanctity attributed to it is sometimes explained by a
          belief that it is the seat of a spirit which is very sensitive to
          injury or disrespect. Thus the Yorubas of the Slave Coast hold that
          every man has three spiritual inmates, of whom the first, called
          Olori, dwells in the head and is the man's protector, guardian, and
          guide. Offerings are made to this spirit, chiefly of fowls, and

          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kwun</span></span> dwells in the human head,
          of which it is the guardian spirit. The spirit must be carefully
          protected from injury of every kind; hence the act of shaving or
          cutting the hair is accompanied with many ceremonies. The
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kwun</span></span> is very sensitive on points
          of honour, and would feel mortally insulted if the head in which he
          resides were touched by the hand of a stranger. When Dr. Bastian,
          in conversation with a brother of the king of Siam, raised his hand
          to touch the prince's skull in order to illustrate some medical
          remarks he was making, a sullen and threatening murmur bursting
          from the lips of the crouching <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          etiquette he had committed, for in Siam there is no greater insult
          to a man of rank than to touch his head. If a Siamese touch the
          head of another with his foot, both of them must build chapels to
          the earth-spirit to avert the omen. Nor does the guardian spirit of
          the head like to have the hair washed too often; it might injure or
          incommode him. It was a grand solemnity when the king of Burma's
          head was washed with water drawn from the middle of the river.
          Whenever the native professor, from whom Dr. Bastian took lessons
          in Burmese at Mandalay, had his head washed, which took place as a
          rule once a month, he was generally absent for three days together,
          that time being consumed in preparing for, and recovering from, the
          operation of head-washing. Dr. Bastian's custom of washing his head

          ascend the staircase, to reach which he must have passed under a

          in a ship's cabin, offered a high price for them, that they might
          not be degraded <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg

          over their heads; and the meanest Cambodian would never consent to
          live under an inhabited room. Hence the houses are built of one
          story only; and even the Government respects the prejudice by never

          this channel at baptism. Hence they carefully guard their heads
          against injury, especially against any wound that might draw blood,
          for they think that such a wound would entail the loss of reason on

              operation. The hair of kings, priests, chiefs, sorcerers, and
              other tabooed persons is sometimes kept unshorn. Hair kept

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the head
          was considered so sacred that it might not even be touched without
          grave offence, it is obvious that the cutting of the hair must have
          been a delicate and difficult operation. The difficulties and
          dangers which, on the primitive view, beset the operation are of
          two kinds. There is first the danger of disturbing the spirit of
          the head, which may be injured in the process and may revenge
          itself upon the person who molests him. Secondly, there is the
          difficulty of disposing of the shorn locks. For the savage believes
          that the sympathetic connexion which exists between himself and
          every part of his body continues to exist even after the physical
          connexion has been broken, and that therefore he will suffer from
          any harm that may befall the severed parts of his body, such as the
          clippings of his hair or the parings of his nails. Accordingly he
          takes care that these severed portions of himself shall not be left
          in places where they might either be exposed to accidental injury
          or fall into the hands of malicious persons who might work magic on
          them to his detriment or death. Such dangers are common to all, but
          sacred persons have more to fear from them than ordinary people, so
          the precautions taken by them are proportionately stringent. The
          simplest way of evading the peril is not to cut the hair at all;
          and this is the expedient adopted where the risk is thought to be
          more than usually great. The Frankish kings were never allowed to
          crop their hair; from their childhood upwards they had to keep it
          unshorn.<a id="noteref_878" name="noteref_878" href=

          two sons of Clodomir; and having done so, they sent a messenger
          bearing scissors and a naked sword to the children's grandmother,
          Queen Clotilde, at Paris. The envoy shewed the scissors and the
          sword to Clotilde, and bade her choose whether the children should
          be shorn and live or remain unshorn and die. The proud queen
          replied that if her grandchildren were not to come to the throne
          she would rather see them dead than shorn. And murdered they were

          Elsewhere men travelling abroad have been in the habit of leaving
          their hair unshorn until their return. The reason for this custom
          is probably the danger to which, as we have seen, a traveller is
          believed to be exposed from the magic arts of the strangers amongst
          whom he sojourns; if they got possession of his shorn hair, they

          Possibly in this case there was a special objection to touching the
          tabooed man's head with iron. The Roman priests, as we have seen,
          were shorn with bronze knives. The same feeling perhaps gave rise
          to the European rule that a child's nails should not be pared
          during the first year, but that if it is absolutely necessary to
          shorten them they should be bitten off by the mother or

          Amongst the Ewe negroes of the Slave Coast, a mother sometimes vows
          a sacrifice to the fetish if her infant should live. She then

          If the boy thus dedicated is a Moslem, he becomes in time a

          remarkable custom has been described more fully by another
          observer. The old heathen temple at Namosi is called Rukunitambua,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and round about it are hundreds of stones,
          each of which tells a fearful tale. A subject tribe, whose town was
          some little distance from Namosi, had committed an unpardonable
          offence, and were condemned to a frightful doom. The earth-mound on
          which their temple had stood was planted with the mountain
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          was ripe, the poor wretches had to carry it down to Namosi, and
          give at least one of their number to be killed and eaten by the
          chief. He used to take advantage of these occasions to have his
          hair cut, for the human sacrifice was supposed to avert all danger
          of witchcraft if any ill-wisher got hold of the cuttings of his
          hair, human hair being the most dangerous channel for the deadliest
          spells of the sorcerers. The stones round Rukunitambua represented
          these and other victims who had been killed and eaten at Namosi.

          person who cuts the hair is also tabooed; his hands having been in
          contact with a sacred head, he may not touch food with them or
          engage in any other employment; he is fed by another person with
          food cooked over a sacred fire. He cannot be released from the
          taboo before the following day, when he rubs his hands with potato
          or fern root which has been cooked on a sacred fire; and this food
          having been taken to the head of the family in the female line and
          eaten by her, his hands are freed from the taboo. In some parts of
          New Zealand the most sacred day of the year was that appointed for

          child a hopeless wreck for life. Great pains are therefore taken to
          recall this mysterious being in case he should have fled, and to
          fix him securely in the child. This is the object of an elaborate
          ceremony performed on the afternoon of the day when the top-knot
          has been cut. A miniature pagoda is erected, and on it are placed
          several kinds of food known to be favourites of the spirit. When

          family and friends form a circle, with the child, the captured
          spirit, and the Brahman priests in the middle. Hereupon the priests
          address the spirit, earnestly entreating him to enter into the
          child. They amuse him with tales, and coax and wheedle him with
          flattery, jest, and song; the gongs ring out their loudest; the
          people cheer and only a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          obdurate disposition could resist the combined appeal. The last
          sentences of the formal invocation run as follows: <span class=

          tender, delicate, and wavering as to cause great anxiety concerning
          thy fate; thou was exactly like a child, youthful, innocent, and
          inexperienced. The least trifle frightened thee and made thee
          shudder. In thy infantile playfulness thou wast wont to frolic and
          wander to no purpose. As thou didst commence to learn to sit, and,

          or on thy back. As thou didst grow up in years and couldst move thy
          steps firmly, thou didst begin to run and sport thoughtlessly and
          rashly all round the rooms, the terrace, and bridging planks of
          travelling boat or floating house, and at times thou didst fall
          into the stream, creek, or pond, among the floating water-weeds, to
          the utter dismay of those to whom thy existence was most dear. O
          gentle <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          particles of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          water assemble and take permanent abode in this darling little
          child. Let them all hurry to the site of this auspicious ceremony
          and admire the magnificent preparations made for them in this
          hall.”</span> The brocaded cloth from the pagoda, under which lurks
          the captive spirit, is now rolled up tightly and handed to the
          child, who is told to clasp it firmly to his breast and not let the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          drinks the milk of the coco-nuts which had been offered to the
          spirit, and by thus absorbing the food of the <span class=

          attested by evidence too ample, too familiar, and too tedious in
          its uniformity to be here analysed at length. The general idea on
          which the superstition rests is that of the sympathetic connexion
          supposed to persist between a person and everything that has once
          been part of his body or in any way closely related to him. A very
          few examples must suffice. They belong to that branch of

          the man he wished to injure, wrapped it up in a leaf, and placed
          the packet in a bag woven of threads or fibres, which were knotted
          in an intricate way. The whole was then buried with certain rites,
          and thereupon the victim wasted away of a languishing sickness
          which lasted twenty days. His life, however, might be saved by
          discovering and digging up the buried hair, spittle, or what not;

          leaves the bone in the midst of the fire or removes it and lays it
          in the sun. When he thinks he has done his enemy enough harm, he

          certain seasons, and has to observe strict continence for a month
          before he handles these holy relics in the offices of religion. A

          when the Nandi have taken a prisoner they shave his head and keep
          the shorn hair as a surety that he will not attempt to escape; but

          similar reason, perhaps, when the Tiaha, an Arab tribe of Moab,
          have taken a prisoner whom they do not wish to put to death, they
          shave one corner of his head above his temples and let him go. So,
          too, an Arab of Moab who pardons a murderer will sometimes cut off
          the man's hair and shave his chin before releasing him. Again, when
          two Moabite Arabs had got hold of a traitor who had revealed their
          plan of campaign to the enemy, they contented themselves with
          shaving completely one side of his head and his moustache on the

          intention, we may conjecture, was not simply to put a gross affront
          on the envoys. He distrusted the ambitious designs of King David
          and wished to have some guarantee of the maintenance of peace and
          friendly relations between the two countries. That guarantee he may
          have imagined that he possessed in half of the beards and garments
          of the ambassadors; and if that was so, we may suppose that when
          the indignant David set the army of Israel in motion against Ammon,
          and the fords of Jordan were alive with the passage of his troops,
          the wizards of Ammon were busy in the strong keep of Rabbah
          muttering their weird spells and performing their quaint
          enchantments over the shorn hair and severed skirts in order to
          dispel the thundercloud of war that was gathering black about their
          country. Vain hopes! The city fell, and from the gates the sad
          inhabitants trooped forth in thousands to be laid in long lines on
          the ground and sawed asunder or ripped up with harrows or to walk
          into the red glow of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg

          Again, the parings of nails may serve the same purpose as the
          clippings of hair; they too may be treated as bail for the good
          behaviour of the persons from whose fingers they have been cut. It
          is apparently on this principle that when the Ba-yaka of the Congo
          valley cement a peace, the chiefs of the two tribes meet and eat a
          cake which contains some of their nail-parings as a pledge of the
          maintenance of the treaty. They believe that he who breaks an

          the Aru Islands, when a child is able to run alone, a female
          relation shears a lock of its hair and deposits it on a
          banana-tree.<a id="noteref_969" name="noteref_969" href=

          the island of Rotti it is thought that the first hair which a child
          gets is not his own, and that, if it is not cut off, it will make
          him weak and ill. Hence, when the child is about a month old, his
          hair is polled with much ceremony. As each of the friends who are
          invited to the ceremony enters the house he goes up to the child,
          snips off a little of its hair and drops it into a coco-nut shell
          full of water. Afterwards the father or another relation takes the
          hair and packs it into a little bag made of leaves, which he
          fastens to the top of a palm-tree. Then he gives the leaves of the
          palm a good shaking, climbs down, and goes home without speaking to
          any one.<a id="noteref_970" name="noteref_970" href=

          Indians of the Yukon territory, Alaska, do not throw away their cut
          hair and nails, but tie them up in little bundles and place them in

          disturbed by beasts. For <span class="tei tei-q">“they have a

          this subject, on which I have perhaps dwelt too long, it may be

          that island the first hair is regarded as a danger to the child,
          and its removal is intended to avert the danger. The reason of this
          may be that as a young child is almost universally supposed to be
          in a tabooed or dangerous state, it is necessary, in removing the
          taboo, to remove also the separable <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> parts of the child's body because they are
          infected, so to say, by the virus of taboo and as such are
          dangerous. The cutting of the child's hair would thus be exactly
          parallel to the destruction of the vessels which have been used by
          a tabooed person.<a id="noteref_1022" name="noteref_1022" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1022</span></span></a> This
          view is borne out by a practice, observed by some Australians, of
          burning off part of a woman's hair after childbirth as well as
          burning every vessel which has been used by her during her
          seclusion.<a id="noteref_1023" name="noteref_1023" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1023</span></span></a> Here
          the burning of the woman's hair seems plainly intended to serve the
          same purpose as the burning of the vessels used by her; and as the
          vessels are burned because they are believed to be tainted with a
          dangerous infection, so, we must suppose, is also the hair.
          Similarly among the Latuka of central Africa, a woman is secluded
          for fourteen days after the birth of her child, and at the end of
          her seclusion her hair is shaved off and burnt.<a id="noteref_1024"

          Again, we have seen that girls at puberty are strongly infected
          with taboo; hence it is not surprising to find that the Ticunas of
          Brazil tear out all the hair of girls at that period.<a id=

          more, the father of twins in Uganda is tabooed for some time after
          the birth of the children, and during that time he may not dress
          his hair nor cut his finger nails. This state of taboo lasts until
          the next war breaks out. When the army is under orders to march,
          the father of twins has the whole of his body shaved and his nails
          cut. The shorn hair and the cut nails are then tied up in a ball,
          which the man takes with him to the war, together with the bark
          cloth he wore at the ceremonial dances after the birth of the
          twins. When he has killed a foe, he crams the ball into the dead
          man's mouth, ties the bark cloth round the neck of the corpse, and
          leaves them there on the battlefield.<a id="noteref_1026" name=

          ceremony appears to be intended to rid the man of the taint of
          taboo which may be supposed to adhere to his hair, nails, and the
          garment he wore. Hence we can understand the importance attached by
          many <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name=

          we have seen that a traveller is often believed to contract a
          dangerous infection from strangers, and that, therefore, on his
          return home he is obliged to submit to various purificatory
          ceremonies before he is allowed to mingle freely with his own
          people.<a id="noteref_1029" name="noteref_1029" href=

          my hypothesis the polling of the hair is simply one of these
          purificatory or disinfectant ceremonies. Certainly this explanation
          applies to the custom as practised by the Bechuanas, for we are
          expressly told that <span class="tei tei-q">“they cleanse or purify
          themselves after journeys by shaving their heads, etc., lest they
          should have contracted from strangers some evil by witchcraft or
          sorcery.”</span><a id="noteref_1030" name="noteref_1030" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1030</span></span></a> The
          cutting of the hair after a vow may have the same meaning. It is a
          way of ridding the man of what has been infected by the dangerous
          state, whether we call it taboo, sanctity, or uncleanness (for all
          these are only different expressions for the same primitive
          conception), under which he laboured during the continuance of the
          vow. Still more clearly does the meaning of the practice come out
          in the case of mourners, who cut their hair and nails and use new
          vessels when the period of their mourning is at an end. This was
          done in ancient India, obviously for the purpose of purifying such
          persons from the dangerous influence of death and the ghost to
          which for a time they had been exposed.<a id="noteref_1031" name=

          Among the Bodos and Dhimals of Assam, when a death has occurred,
          the family of the deceased is reckoned unclean for three days. At
          the end of that time they bathe, shave, and are sprinkled with holy
          water, after which they hold the funeral feast.<a id="noteref_1032"

          of shaving must clearly be regarded as a purificatory rite, like
          the bathing and sprinkling with holy water. At Hierapolis no man
          might enter the great temple of Astarte on the same day on which he
          had seen a corpse; next day he might enter, provided he had first
          purified himself. But the kinsmen of the deceased were not allowed
          to set foot in the sanctuary for thirty days after the death, and
          before doing so they had to shave their heads.<a id="noteref_1033"

          head, the barber's knife is kept busy enough. As each man leaves
          the barber's hands, he gathers up the shorn locks and spitting on

          together with seven earthworms beaten to a paste and several
          splinters from a tree which has been struck by lightning. He then
          goes into the forest, digs a hole at the foot of a tree which has

          hole, then fills in the earth, and makes a fire over the spot to
          destroy all traces of his work. If the ceremony has been properly
          carried out, the man whose spittle has thus been treated begins to

          guarantee of good faith. If either of them afterwards forswears
          himself, the other can punish his perfidy by a magical treatment of
          the perjurer's spittle which he has in his custody. Thus when the
          Wajagga of East Africa desire to make a covenant, the two parties
          will sometimes sit down with a bowl of milk or beer between them,
          and after uttering an incantation over the beverage they each take

          These rules are probably of kindred significance, and may
          conveniently be considered together. To begin with knots, many
          people in different parts of the world entertain a strong objection
          to having any knot about their person at certain critical seasons,
          particularly childbirth, marriage, and death. Thus among the Saxons
          of Transylvania, when a woman is in travail all knots on her
          garments are untied, because it is believed that this will
          facilitate her delivery, and with the same intention all the locks
          in the house, whether on doors or boxes, are unlocked.<a id=

          Lapps think that a lying-in woman should have no knot on her

          Roman religion required that women who took part in the rites of

          the East Indies this superstition is extended to the whole time of
          pregnancy; the people believe that if a pregnant woman were to tie
          knots, or braid, or make anything fast, the child would thereby be

          some of them enforce the observance of the rule on the father as
          well as the mother of the unborn child. Among the Sea Dyaks neither

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all these
          cases the idea seems to be that the tying of a knot would, as they
          say in the East Indies, <span class="tei tei-q">“tie up”</span> the
          woman, in other words, impede and perhaps prevent her delivery, or
          delay her convalescence after the birth. On the principles of
          homoeopathic or imitative magic the physical obstacle or impediment
          of a knot on a cord would create a corresponding obstacle or
          impediment in the body of the woman. That this is really the
          explanation of the rule appears from a custom observed by the Hos
          of Togoland in West Africa at a difficult birth. When a woman is in
          hard labour and cannot bring forth, they call in a magician to her
          aid. He looks at her and says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The child
          is bound in the womb, that is why she cannot be delivered.”</span>
          On the entreaties of her female relations he then promises to loose
          the bond so that she may bring forth. For that purpose he orders
          them to fetch a tough creeper from the forest, and with it he binds
          the hands and feet of the sufferer on her back. Then he takes a
          knife and calls out the woman's name, and when she answers he cuts
          through the creeper with a knife, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I cut through to-day thy bonds and thy child's
          bonds.”</span> After that he chops up the creeper small, puts the
          bits in a vessel of water, and bathes the woman with the
          water.<a id="noteref_1085" name="noteref_1085" href=

          the cutting of the creeper with which the woman's hands and feet

          296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          limbs from their bonds the magician imagines that he simultaneously
          releases the child in her womb from the trammels which impede its
          birth. For a similar reason, no doubt, among the same people a
          priest ties up the limbs of a pregnant woman with grass and then
          unties the knots, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will now open
          you.”</span> After that the woman has to partake of some
          maize-porridge in which a ring made of a magic cord had been
          previously placed by the priest.<a id="noteref_1086" name=

          intention of this ceremony is probably, on the principles of
          homoeopathic magic, to ensure for the woman an easy delivery by
          releasing her from the bonds of grass. The same train of thought
          underlies a practice observed by some peoples of opening all locks,
          doors, and so on, while a birth is taking place in the house. We
          have seen that at such a time the Germans of Transylvania open all
          the locks, and the same thing is done also in Voigtland and

          perhaps points to the observance of a similar custom. In the island

          also from sitting with crossed legs during his wife's pregnancy.
          The train of thought is the same in both cases. Whether you cross
          threads in tying a knot, or only cross your legs in sitting at your
          ease, you are equally, on the principles of homoeopathic magic,
          crossing or thwarting the free course of things, and your action
          cannot but check and impede whatever may be going forward in your
          neighbourhood. Of this important truth the Romans were fully aware.
          To sit beside a pregnant woman or a patient under medical treatment
          with clasped hands, says the grave Pliny, is to cast a malignant
          spell over the person, and it is worse still if you nurse your leg
          or legs with your clasped hands, or lay one leg over the other.
          Such postures were regarded by the old Romans as a let and
          hindrance to business of every sort, and at a council of war or a
          meeting of magistrates, at prayers and sacrifices, no man was

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The magical
          effect of knots in trammelling and obstructing human activity was
          believed to be manifested at marriage not less than at birth.
          During the Middle Ages, and down to the eighteenth century, it
          seems to have been commonly held in Europe that the consummation of
          marriage could be prevented by any one who, while the wedding
          ceremony was taking place, either locked a lock or tied a knot in a
          cord, and then threw the lock or the cord away. The lock or the
          knotted cord had to be flung into water; and until it had been
          found and unlocked, or untied, no real union of the married pair
          was possible.<a id="noteref_1105" name="noteref_1105" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1105</span></span></a>
          Hence it was a grave offence, not only to cast such a spell, but
          also to steal or make away with the material instrument of it,
          whether lock or knotted cord. In the year 1718 the parliament of
          Bordeaux sentenced some one to be burned alive for having spread
          desolation through a whole family by means of knotted cords; and in
          1705 two persons were condemned to death in Scotland for stealing
          certain charmed knots which a woman had made, in order thereby to
          mar the wedded happiness of Spalding of Ashintilly.<a id=

          belief in the efficacy of these charms appears to have lingered in
          the Highlands of Perthshire down to the end of the eighteenth
          century, for at that time it was still customary in the beautiful
          parish of Logierait, between the river Tummel and the river Tay, to
          unloose carefully every knot in the clothes of the bride and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name=
          "Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> bridegroom before
          the celebration of the marriage ceremony. When the ceremony was
          over, and the bridal party had left the church, the bridegroom
          immediately retired one way with some young men to tie the knots
          that had been loosed a little before; and the bride in like manner
          withdrew somewhere else to adjust the disorder of her dress.<a id=

          some parts of the Highlands it was deemed enough that the
          bridegroom's left shoe should be without buckle or latchet,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to prevent witches from depriving him, on

          meet with the same superstition and the same custom at the present
          day in Syria. The persons who help a Syrian bridegroom to don his
          wedding garments take care that no knot is tied on them and no
          button buttoned, for they believe that a button buttoned or a knot
          tied would put it within the power of his enemies to deprive him of
          his nuptial rights by magical means.<a id="noteref_1109" name=

          Lesbos the malignant person who would thus injure a bridegroom on
          his wedding day ties a thread to a bush, while he utters
          imprecations; but the bridegroom can defeat the spell by wearing at
          his girdle a piece of an old net or of an old mantilla belonging to
          the bride in which knots have been tied.<a id="noteref_1110" name=

          fear of such charms is diffused all over North Africa at the
          present day. To render a bridegroom impotent the enchanter has only
          to tie a knot in a handkerchief which he had previously placed
          quietly on some part of the bridegroom's body when he was mounted
          on horseback ready to fetch his bride: so long as the knot in the
          handkerchief <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg
          301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          remains tied, so long will the bridegroom remain powerless to
          consummate the marriage. Another way of effecting the same object
          is to stand behind the bridegroom when he is on horseback, with an
          open clasp-knife or pair of scissors in your hand and to call out
          his name; if he imprudently answers, you at once shut the
          clasp-knife or the pair of scissors with a snap, and that makes him
          impotent. To guard against this malignant spell the bridegroom's
          mother will sometimes buy a penknife on the eve of the marriage,
          shut it up, and then open it just at the moment when her son is
          about to enter the bridal chamber.<a id="noteref_1111" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A curious use is
          made of knots at marriage in the little East Indian island of
          Rotti. When a man has paid the price of his bride, a cord is
          fastened round her waist, if she is a maid, but not otherwise. Nine
          knots are tied in the cord, and in order to make them harder to
          unloose, they are smeared with wax. Bride and bridegroom are then
          secluded in a chamber, where he has to untie the knots with the
          thumb and forefinger of his left hand only. It may be from one to
          twelve months before he succeeds in undoing them all. Until he has
          done so he may not look on the woman as his wife. In no case may
          the cord be broken, or the bridegroom would render himself liable
          to any fine that the bride's father might choose to impose. When
          all the knots are loosed, the woman is his wife, and he shews the
          cord to her father, and generally presents his wife with a golden
          or silver necklace instead of the cord.<a id="noteref_1112" name=

          meaning of this custom is not clear, but we may conjecture that the
          nine knots refer to the nine months of pregnancy, and that
          miscarriage would be the supposed result of leaving a single knot
          untied.</p>

          Babylonian witches and wizards of old used to strangle their

          spitting upon them. He goes on to relate how, once upon a time, a
          wicked Jew bewitched the prophet Mohammed himself by tying nine
          knots on a string, which he then hid in a well. So the prophet fell
          ill, and nobody knows what might have happened if the archangel
          Gabriel had not opportunely revealed to the holy man the place
          where the knotted cord was concealed. The trusty Ali soon fetched
          the baleful thing from the well; and the prophet recited over it
          certain charms, which were specially revealed to him for the
          purpose. At every verse of the charms a knot untied itself, and the

          Australian mode of operation is as follows. When a blackfellow
          wishes to settle old scores with another blackfellow, he ties a
          rope of fibre or bark so tightly round the neck of his slumbering
          friend as partially to choke him. Having done this he takes out the
          man's caul-fat from under his short rib, ties up his inside
          carefully with string, replaces the skin, and having effaced all
          external marks of the wound, makes off with the stolen fat. The
          victim on awakening feels no inconvenience, but sooner or later,
          sometimes months afterwards, while he is hunting or exerting
          himself violently in some other way, he will feel the string snap
          in his inside. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hallo,”</span> says he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“somebody has tied me up inside with
          string!”</span> and he goes home to the camp and dies on the
          spot.<a id="noteref_1117" name="noteref_1117" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If knots are
          supposed to kill, they are also supposed to cure. This follows from
          the belief that to undo the knots which are causing sickness will
          bring the sufferer relief. But apart from this negative virtue of
          maleficent knots, there are certain beneficent knots to which a
          positive power of healing is ascribed. Pliny tells us that some
          folk cured diseases of the groin by taking a thread from a web,
          tying seven or nine knots on it, and then fastening it to the
          patient's groin; but to make the cure effectual it was necessary to
          name some widow as each knot was tied.<a id="noteref_1118" name=

          ancient Assyrians seem to have made much use of knotted cords as a
          remedy for ailments and disease. The cord with its knots, which
          were sometimes twice seven in number, was tied round the head,
          neck, or limbs of the patient, and then after a time cut off and
          thrown away, carrying with it, as was apparently supposed, the
          aches and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg

          pains of the sufferer. Sometimes the magic cord which was used for
          this beneficent purpose consisted of a double strand of black and
          white wool; sometimes it was woven of the hair of a virgin
          kid.<a id="noteref_1119" name="noteref_1119" href=

          modern Arab cure for fever reported from the ruins of Nineveh is to
          tie a cotton thread with seven knots on it round the wrist of the
          patient, who must wear it for seven or eight days or till such time
          as the fever passes, after which he may throw it away.<a id=

          O'Donovan describes a similar remedy for fever employed among the
          Turcomans. The enchanter takes some camel hair and spins it into a
          stout thread, droning a spell the while. Next he ties seven knots
          on the thread, blowing on each knot before he pulls it tight. This
          knotted thread is then worn as a bracelet on his wrist by the
          patient. Every day one of the knots is untied and blown upon, and
          when the seventh knot is undone the whole thread is rolled up into
          a ball and thrown into a river, bearing away (as they imagine) the
          fever with it.<a id="noteref_1121" name="noteref_1121" href=

          in the fire, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I put the disease and
          the sickness on the top of the fire,”</span> and ties the rest of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Russia
          amulets often derive their protective virtue in great measure from
          knots. Here, for example, is a spell which will warrant its
          employer against all risk of being shot: <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          attach five knots to each hostile, infidel shooter, over
          arquebuses, bows, and all manner of warlike weapons. <span class=

          warlike weapons do me hurt. In my knots lies hid the mighty
          strength of snakes—from the twelve-headed snake.”</span> A net,
          from its affluence of knots, has always been considered in Russia
          very efficacious against sorcerers; hence in some places, when a
          bride is being dressed in her wedding attire, a fishing-net is
          flung over her to keep her out of harm's way. For a similar purpose
          the bridegroom and his companions are often girt with pieces of
          net, or at least with tight-drawn girdles, for before a wizard can
          begin to injure them he must undo all the knots in the net, or take
          off the girdles. But often a Russian amulet is merely a knotted
          thread. A skein of red wool wound about the arms and legs is
          thought to ward off agues and fevers; and nine skeins, fastened
          round a child's neck, are deemed a preservative against scarlatina.
          In the Tver Government a bag of a special kind is tied to the neck
          of the cow which walks before the rest of a herd, in order to keep
          off wolves; its force binds the maw of the ravening beast. On the
          same principle, a padlock is carried thrice round a herd of horses
          before they go afield in the spring, and the bearer locks and
          unlocks it as he goes, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I lock from
          my herd the mouths of the grey wolves with this steel lock.”</span>
          After the third round the padlock is finally locked, and then, when
          the horses have gone off, it is hidden away somewhere till late in
          the autumn, when the time comes for the drove to return to winter
          quarters. In this case the <span class="tei tei-q">“firm
          word”</span> of the spell is supposed to lock up the mouths of the
          wolves. The Bulgarians have a similar mode of guarding their cattle
          against wild beasts. A woman takes a needle and thread after dark,

          threshing-floor called <span class="tei tei-q">‘Goigote’</span>—the
          tying of the cultivator's knot. When a sheaf of corn has been
          threshed out, before it is removed the grain is heaped up and the
          threshers, generally six in number, sit round it, and taking a few
          stalks, with the ears of corn attached, jointly tie a knot and bury
          it in the heap. It is left there until all the sheaves have been
          threshed, and the corn winnowed and measured. The object of this
          ceremony is to prevent the devils from diminishing the quantity of
          corn in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg

          Knots and locks may serve to avert not only devils but death
          itself. When they brought a woman to the stake at St. Andrews in
          1572 to burn her alive for a witch, they found on her a white cloth
          like a collar, with strings and many knots on the strings. They
          took it from her, sorely against her will, for she seemed to think
          that she could not die in the fire, if only the cloth with the
          knotted strings was on her. When it was taken away, she said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Now I have no hope of

          many parts of England it is thought that a person cannot die so
          long as any locks are locked or bolts shot in the house. It is

          action in hand, whatever it may be, by the presence of any knot or
          constriction, whether on the head or on the feet of the performer.
          This connexion of ideas comes out clearly in a passage of Ovid, who

          is less easy to say why on certain solemn occasions it appears to
          have been customary with some people to go with one shoe off and
          one shoe on. The forlorn hope of two hundred men who, on a dark and
          stormy night, stole out of Plataea, broke through the lines of the
          besieging Spartans, and escaped from the doomed city, were shod on
          the left foot only. The historian who records the fact assumes that
          the intention was to prevent their feet from slipping in the

          if so, why were not both feet unshod or shod? What is good for the
          one foot is surely good for the other. The peculiar attire of the
          Plataeans on this occasion had probably nothing to do with the
          particular state of the ground and the weather at the time when
          they made their desperate sally, but was an old custom, a form of
          consecration or devotion, observed by men in any great hazard or
          grave emergency. Certainly the costume appears to have been
          regularly worn by some fighting races in antiquity, at least when
          they went forth to battle. Thus we are told that all the Aetolians
          were shod only on one foot, <span class="tei tei-q">“because they

          ancient writers, but may be inferred from a scene painted on a

          is seen crouching on the skin of a sacrificial victim, his bare
          right foot resting on the skin, while his left foot, shod in a

          Among the heathen Arabs the cursing of an enemy was a public act.
          The maledictions were often couched in the form of a satirical
          poem, which the poet himself recited with certain solemn
          formalities. Thus when the young Lebid appeared at the Court of
          Norman to denounce the Absites, he anointed the hair of his head on
          one side only, let his garment hang down loosely, and wore but one
          shoe. This, we are told, was the costume regularly adopted by

          the magical virtue attributed to knots; for down to recent times,
          we may take it, shoes have been universally tied to the feet by
          latchets. Now the magical action of a knot, as we have seen, is
          supposed to be to bind and restrain not merely the body but the

          this action is beneficial or harmful according as the thing which

          corollary of this doctrine that to be without knots is to be free
          and untrammelled, which, by the way, may be the reason why the

          would never do for a divining rod to be spell-bound. Hence we may
          suppose that the intention of going with one shoe on and one shoe
          off is both to restrain and to set at liberty, to bind and to
          unbind. But to bind or unbind whom or what? Perhaps the notion is
          to rid the man himself of magical restraint, but to lay it on his
          foe, or at all events on his foe's magic; in short, to bind his
          enemy by a spell while he himself goes free. This is substantially
          the explanation which the acute and learned Servius gives of Dido's
          costume. He says that she went with one shoe on and one shoe off in
          order that Aeneas might be entangled and herself released.<a id=

          analogous explanation would obviously apply to all the other cases
          we have considered, for in all of them the man who wears this
          peculiar costume is confronted with hostile powers, whether human
          or supernatural, which it must be his object to lay under a

          to bind and hamper spiritual as well as bodily activities is

          it is plain that even if the soul is not definitely supposed to
          issue at death from the finger-tips, yet the ring is conceived to
          exercise a certain constrictive influence which detains and
          imprisons the immortal spirit in spite of its efforts to escape
          from the tabernacle of clay; in short the ring, like the knot, acts
          as a spiritual fetter. This may have been the reason of an ancient
          Greek maxim, attributed to Pythagoras, which forbade people to wear

          we are only concerned with the belief in so far as it seems to
          throw light on the rule that the Flamen Dialis might not wear a

          which forbade him to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg

          have a knot on his garments, it points to a fear that the powerful
          spirit embodied in him might be trammelled and hampered in its
          goings-out and comings-in by such corporeal and spiritual fetters
          as rings and knots. The same fear probably dictated the rule that
          if a man in bonds were taken into the house of the Flamen Dialis,
          the captive was to be unbound and the cords to be drawn up through
          a hole in the roof and so let down into the street.<a id=

          Further, we may conjecture that the custom of releasing prisoners
          at a festival may have originated in the same train of thought; it
          might be imagined that their fetters would impede the flow of the
          divine grace. The custom was observed at the Greek festival of the
          Thesmophoria,<a id="noteref_1181" name="noteref_1181" href=
          "#note_1181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          at the Athenian festival of Dionysus in the city.<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1182</span></span></a> At
          the great festival of the Dassera, celebrated in October by the
          Goorkhas of Nepaul, all the law courts are closed, and all
          prisoners in gaol are removed from the precincts of the city; but
          those who are imprisoned outside the city do not have to change
          their place of confinement at the time of the Dassera.<a id=

          Nepaulese custom appears strongly to support the explanation here
          suggested of such gaol-deliveries. For observe that the prisoners
          are not released, but merely removed from the city. The intention
          is therefore not to allow them to share the general happiness, but
          merely to rid the city of their inopportune presence at the
          festival.</p>

          the meaning of the famous Gordian knot, which Alexander the Great,
          failing in his efforts to untie it, cut through with his sword. In
          Gordium, the ancient capital of the kings of Phrygia, there was
          preserved a waggon of which the yoke was fastened to the pole by a
          strip of cornel-bark or a vine-shoot twisted and tied in an
          intricate knot. Tradition ran that the waggon had been dedicated by
          Midas, the first king of the dynasty, and that whoever untied the
          knot would be ruler of Asia.<a id="noteref_1184" name=

          317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the knot was a talisman with which the fate of the dynasty was
          believed to be bound up in such a way that whenever the knot was
          loosed the reign of the dynasty would come to an end. We have seen
          that the magic virtue ascribed to knots is naturally enough
          supposed to last only so long as they remain untied. If the Gordian
          knot was the talisman of the Phrygian kings, the local fame it
          enjoyed, as guaranteeing to them the rule of Phrygia, might easily
          be exaggerated by distant rumour into a report that the sceptre of

          inflicted on any part of his physical organism. This belief was

          Tolampoos of central Celebes believe that if you write a man's name
          down you can carry off his soul along with it. On that account the
          headman of a village appeared uneasy when Mr. A. C. Kruijt wrote
          down his name. He entreated the missionary to erase it, and was
          only reassured on being told that it was not his real name but
          merely his second name that had been put on paper. Again, when the
          same missionary took down the names of villages from the lips of a

          we may judge from the evidence of language, this crude conception
          of the relation of names to persons was widely prevalent, if not
          universal, among the forefathers of the Aryan race. For an analysis
          of the words for <span class="tei tei-q">“name”</span> in the
          various languages of that great family of speech points to the
          conclusion that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Celts, and certain
          other widely separated Aryans, unless we should rather say the
          whole Aryan family, believed at one time not only that the name was
          a part of the man, but that it was that part of him which is termed
          the soul, the breath of life, or whatever you may choose to define
          it as being.”</span><a id="noteref_1190" name="noteref_1190" href=

          However this may have been among the primitive Aryans, it is quite
          certain that many savages at the present day regard their names as

          Another writer, who knew the Australians well, observes that in
          many tribes the belief prevails <span class="tei tei-q">“that the
          life of an enemy may be taken by the use of his name in
          incantations. The consequence of this idea is, that in the tribes
          in which it obtains, the name of the male is given up for ever at
          the time when he undergoes the first of a series of ceremonies
          which end in conferring the rights of manhood. In such tribes a man
          has no name, and when a man desires to attract the attention of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name=
          "Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> any male of his
          tribe who is out of his boyhood, instead of calling him by name, he
          addresses him as brother, nephew, or cousin, as the case may be, or
          by the name of the class to which he belongs. I used to notice,
          when I lived amongst the Bangerang, that the names which the males
          bore in infancy were soon almost forgotten by the
          tribe.”</span><a id="noteref_1196" name="noteref_1196" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1196</span></span></a> It
          may be questioned, however, whether the writer whom I have just
          quoted was not deceived in thinking that among these tribes men
          gave up their individual names on passing through the ceremony of
          initiation into manhood. It is more in harmony with savage beliefs
          and practices to suppose either that the old names were retained
          but dropped out of use in daily life, or that new names were given
          at initiation and sedulously concealed from fear of sorcery. A
          missionary who resided among the aborigines at Lake Tyers, in
          Victoria, informs us that <span class="tei tei-q">“the blacks have
          great objections to speak of a person by name. In speaking to each
          other they address the person spoken to as brother, cousin, friend,
          or whatever relation the person spoken to bears. Sometimes a black
          bears a name which we would term merely a nickname, as the
          left-handed, or the bad-handed, or the little man. They would speak
          of a person by this name while living, but they would never mention
          the proper name. I found great difficulty in collecting the native
          names of the blacks here. I found afterwards that they had given me
          wrong names; and, on asking the reason why, was informed they had
          two or three names, but they never mentioned their right name for
          fear any one got it, then they would die.”</span><a id=

          Amongst the tribes of central Australia every man, woman, and child
          has, besides a personal name which is in common use, a secret or
          sacred name which is bestowed by the older men upon him or her soon
          after birth, and which is known to none but the fully initiated
          members of the group. This secret name is never mentioned except
          upon the most solemn occasions; to utter it in the hearing of women
          or of men of another group would be a most serious breach of tribal

          the most flagrant case of sacrilege among ourselves. When mentioned
          at all, the name is spoken only in a whisper, and not until the

          by no one but members of the group. <span class="tei tei-q">“The

          leaving the church. The reason for this concealment is that a
          sorcerer cannot act upon a person whose real name he does not know.
          But if he has ascertained his victim's real name, the magician
          takes a particular kind of straw, and muttering something over it
          bends it into a circle and places it under a stone. The person

          persists in so reckless a course he must certainly end by
          dissipating his energy and shattering his constitution. Many a

          when the Nandi men are away on a foray, nobody at home may
          pronounce the names of the absent warriors; they must be referred
          to as birds. Should a child so far forget itself as to mention one
          of the distant ones by name, the mother would rebuke it, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't talk of the birds who are in the
          heavens.”</span><a id="noteref_1244" name="noteref_1244" href=

          Among the Bangala of the Upper Congo, while a man is fishing and
          when he returns with his catch, his proper name is in abeyance and
          nobody may mention it. Whatever the fisherman's real name may be,
          he is called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mwele</span></span> without distinction. The
          reason is that the river is full of spirits, who, if they heard the
          fisherman's real name, might so work against him that he would
          catch little or nothing. Even when he has caught his fish and
          landed with them, the buyer must still not address him by his
          proper name, but must only call him <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mwele</span></span>; for even then, if the
          spirits were to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg
          331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          hear his proper name, they would either bear it in mind and serve
          him out another day, or they might so mar the fish he had caught
          that he would get very little for them. Hence the fisherman can
          extract heavy damages from anybody who mentions his name, or can
          compel the thoughtless speaker to relieve him of the fish at a good
          price so as to restore his luck.<a id="noteref_1245" name=

          the Sulka of New Britain are near the territory of their enemies
          the Gaktei, they take care not to mention them by their proper
          name, believing that were they to do so, their foes would attack
          and slay them. Hence in these circumstances they speak of the
          Gaktei as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">o lapsiek</span></span>, that is, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the rotten tree-trunks,”</span> and they imagine that
          by calling them that they make the limbs of their dreaded enemies
          ponderous and clumsy like logs.<a id="noteref_1246" name=

          example illustrates the extremely materialistic view which these
          savages take of the nature of words; they suppose that the mere
          utterance of an expression signifying clumsiness will
          homoeopathically affect with clumsiness the limbs of their distant
          foemen. Another illustration of this curious misconception is
          furnished by a Caffre superstition that the character of a young
          thief can be reformed by shouting his name over a boiling kettle of
          medicated water, then clapping a lid on the kettle and leaving the
          name to steep in the water for several days. It is not in the least
          necessary that the thief should be aware of the use that is being
          made of his name behind his back; the moral reformation will be
          effected without his knowledge.<a id="noteref_1247" name=

          deemed necessary that a man's real name should be kept secret, it
          is often customary, as we have seen, to call him by a surname or

          secondary names are apparently held to be no part of the man
          himself, so that they may be freely used and divulged to everybody
          without endangering his safety thereby. Sometimes in order to avoid
          the use of his own name a man will be called after his child. Thus

          Similarly among the Nufoors of Dutch New Guinea, grown-up persons
          who are related by marriage may not mention each other's names, but
          it is lawful to mention the names of children; hence in order to
          designate a person whose name they may not pronounce they will
          speak of him or her as the father or mother of So-and-so.<a id=

          widespread custom of naming a father after his child has sometimes
          been supposed to spring from a desire on the father's part to
          assert his paternity, apparently as a means of obtaining those
          rights over his children which had previously, under a system of
          mother-kin, been possessed by the mother.<a id="noteref_1257" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1257</span></span></a> But
          this explanation does not account for the parallel custom of naming
          the mother after her child, which seems commonly to co-exist with
          the practice of naming the father after the child. Still less, if
          possible, does it apply to the customs of calling childless couples
          the father and mother of children which do not exist, of naming
          people after their younger brothers, and of <span class=

          aunts of So-and-so, or as the fathers and mothers of their first
          cousins. But all these practices are explained in a simple and
          natural way if we suppose that they originate in a reluctance to
          utter the real names of persons addressed or directly referred to.
          That reluctance is probably based partly on a fear of attracting
          the notice of evil spirits, partly on a dread of revealing the name
          to sorcerers, who would thereby obtain a handle for injuring the
          owner of the name.<a id="noteref_1258" name="noteref_1258" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It might
          naturally be expected that the reserve so commonly maintained with
          regard to personal names would be dropped or at least relaxed among
          relations and friends. But the reverse of this is often the case.
          It is precisely the persons most intimately connected by blood and
          especially by marriage to whom the rule applies with the greatest
          stringency. Such people are often forbidden, not only to pronounce
          each other's names, but even to utter ordinary words which resemble
          or have a single syllable in common with these names. The persons
          who are thus mutually debarred from mentioning each other's names
          are especially husbands and wives, a man and his wife's parents,
          and a woman and her husband's father. For example, among the
          Caffres of South Africa a woman may not publicly pronounce the
          birth-name of her husband or of any of his brothers, nor may she
          use the interdicted word in its ordinary sense. If her husband, for
          instance, be called u-Mpaka, from <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">impaka</span></span>, a small feline animal,

          Further, a Caffre wife is forbidden to pronounce <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> even mentally the names of her
          father-in-law and of all her husband's male relations in the
          ascending line; and whenever the emphatic syllable of any of their
          names occurs in another word, she must avoid it by substituting
          either an entirely new word, or, at least, another syllable in its
          place. Hence this custom has given rise to an almost distinct
          language among the women, which the Caffres call <span class=

          the putting of direct questions on this subject, so that the
          investigation of personal identity becomes difficult and laborious.

          Among the Dyaks a child never pronounces the names of his parents,
          and is angry if any one else does so in his presence. A husband
          never calls his wife by her name, and she never calls him by his.
          If they have children, they name each other after them,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Father of So-and-so”</span> and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother of So-and-so”</span>; if they have
          no children they use the pronouns <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“he”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“she,”</span>
          or an expression such as <span class="tei tei-q">“he or she whom I
          love”</span>; and in general, members of a Dyak family do not
          mention each other's names.<a id="noteref_1282" name="noteref_1282"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1282</span></span></a>
          Moreover, when the personal names happen also, as they often do, to
          be names of common objects, the Dyak is debarred from designating
          these objects by their ordinary names. For instance, if a man or
          one of his family is called Bintang, which means <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“star,”</span> he must not call a star a star
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bintang</span></span>); he must call it a
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pariama</span></span>. If he or a member of
          his domestic circle bears the name of Bulan, which means
          <span class="tei tei-q">“moon,”</span> he may not speak of the moon
          as the moon (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bulan</span></span>); he must call it
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">penala</span></span>. Hence it comes about
          that in the Dyak language there are two sets of distinct names for
          many objects.<a id="noteref_1283" name="noteref_1283" href=

          Among the sea Dyaks of Sarawak a man may not pronounce the name of
          his father-in-law or mother-in-law without incurring the wrath of
          the spirits. And since he reckons as his father-in-law and
          mother-in-law not only the father and mother of his own wife, but
          also the fathers and mothers of his brothers' wives and sisters'
          husbands, and likewise the fathers and mothers of all his cousins,
          the number of tabooed names may be very considerable and the
          opportunities of error correspondingly numerous. To make confusion
          worse confounded, the names of persons are often the names of
          common things, such as moon, bridge, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> barley, cobra, leopard; so that when any of a
          man's many fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law are called by such
          names, these common words may not pass his lips.<a id=

          Among the Dyaks of Landak and Tajan it is forbidden to mention the
          names of parents and grandparents, sometimes also of
          great-grandparents, whether they are alive or dead.<a id=

          Among the Alfoors or Toradjas of Poso, in central Celebes, you may
          not pronounce the names of your father, mother, grandparents, and
          other near relations. But the strictest taboo is on the names of
          parents-in-law. A son-in-law and a daughter-in-law may not only
          never mention the names of their parents-in-law, but if the names
          happen to be ordinary words of the language, they may never allow
          the words in their common significance to pass their lips. For
          example, if my father is called Njara (<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“horse”</span>), I may not speak of him by that name;
          but in speaking of the animal I am free to use the word horse
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">njara</span></span>). But if my father-in-law
          is called Njara, the case is different, for then not only may I not
          refer to him by his name, but I may not even call a horse a horse;
          in speaking of the animal I must use some other word. The
          missionary who reports the custom is acquainted with a man whose
          mother-in-law rejoices in the name of Ringgi (<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“rixdollar”</span>). When this man has occasion to
          refer to real rixdollars, he alludes to them delicately as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“large guilders”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">roepia
          bose</span></span>). Another man may not use the ordinary word for
          water (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">oewe</span></span>); in speaking of water he
          employs a word (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">owai</span></span>) taken from a different
          dialect. Indeed, among these Alfoors it is the common practice in
          such cases to replace the forbidden word by a kindred word of the
          same significance borrowed from another dialect. In this way many
          fresh terms or new forms of an old word pass into general
          circulation.<a id="noteref_1286" name="noteref_1286" href=
          "#note_1286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> in northern Celebes, the custom is carried
          still further so as to forbid the use even of words which merely
          resemble the personal names in sound. It is especially the name of
          a father-in-law which is thus laid under an interdict. If he, for
          example, is called Kalala, his son-in-law may not speak of a horse
          by its common name <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kawalo</span></span>; he must call it a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“riding-beast”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          among the Alfoors of the island of Buru it is taboo to mention the
          names of parents and parents-in-law, or even to speak of common
          objects by words which resemble these names in sound. Thus, if your
          mother-in-law is called Dalu, which means <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“betel,”</span> you may not ask for betel by its
          ordinary name, you must ask for <span class="tei tei-q">“red
          mouth”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mue miha</span></span>); if you want
          betel-leaf, you may not say betel-leaf (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">dalu
          'mun</span></span>), you must say <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">karon
          fenna</span></span>. In the same island it is also taboo to mention
          the name of an elder brother in his presence.<a id="noteref_1288"

          yourself, except that men may mention the names of their
          brothers-in-law, though women may not. The taboo comes into
          operation as soon as the betrothal has taken place and before the
          marriage has been celebrated. Families thus connected by the
          betrothal of two of their members are not only forbidden to

          words that sound like them are scrupulously avoided and other words
          used in their place. If it should chance that a person has
          inadvertently uttered a forbidden name, he must at once throw

          not mention each other's names, not even when these names have
          passed to younger members of the family. Thus if a child is called

          "font-style: italic">sabi</span></span>, as it is there called,
          concerns the names of relatives by marriage. A man may not mention
          the name of his wife's father, mother, elder sister, or elder
          brother, nor the name of any male or female relative of her father
          or mother, so long as the relative in question is a member of the
          same tribe as the speaker. The names of his wife's younger brothers
          and sisters are not tabooed to him. The same law applies to a woman
          with reference to the names of her husband's relatives. As a
          general rule, this taboo does not extend outside the tribal
          boundaries. Hence when a man or woman marries out of his or her
          tribe, the taboo is usually not applied. And when members of one
          tribe, who may not pronounce each other's names at home, are away
          from their own territory, they are no longer strictly bound to
          observe the prohibition. A breach of the taboo has to be atoned for
          by the offender paying a fine to the person whose name he has taken
          in vain. Until that has been done, neither of the parties
          concerned, if they are males, may enter the men's club-house. In
          the old times the offended party might recover his social standing
          by cutting off somebody else's head.<a id="noteref_1297" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the western
          islands of Torres Straits a man never mentioned the personal names
          of his father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and
          sister-in-law; and a woman was subject to the same restrictions. A
          brother-in-law might be spoken of as the husband or brother of some
          one whose name it was lawful to mention; and similarly a
          sister-in-law might be called the wife of So-and-so. If a man by
          chance used the personal name of his brother-in-law, he was ashamed
          and hung his head. His shame was only relieved when he had made a
          present as compensation to the man whose name he had taken in vain.
          The same compensation was made to a sister-in-law, a father-in-law,
          and a mother-in-law for the accidental mention of their names. This

          the personal names of relatives by marriage was associated with the
          custom, so common throughout the world, that a man or woman is not
          allowed to speak to these relatives. If a man wished to communicate
          with his father-in-law or mother-in-law, he spoke to his wife and
          she spoke to her parent. When direct communication became
          absolutely necessary, it was said that a man might talk to his
          father-in-law or mother-in-law a very little in a low voice. The
          behaviour towards a brother-in-law was the same.<a id=

          Among the natives who inhabit the coast of the Gazelle Peninsula in

          to him. Further, a man is prohibited from mentioning the name of
          his son-in-law, though he is allowed to look at him. And if a
          husband has paid money for his wife to several men, none of these
          men may ever utter his name or look him in the face. If one of them

          the Banks' Islands, Melanesia, the taboos laid on the names of
          persons connected by marriage are very strict. A man will not

          he name his wife's brother; but he may name his wife's sister—she
          is nothing to him. A woman may not name her father-in-law, nor on
          any account her son-in-law. Two people whose children have
          intermarried are also debarred from mentioning each other's names.
          And not only are all these persons forbidden to utter each other's
          names; they may not even pronounce ordinary words which chance to
          be either identical with these names or to have any syllables in
          common with them. <span class="tei tei-q">“A man on one occasion

          neither she nor her sisters might ever look at or speak to him. He
          might not go within fifty yards of their habitation, and when he
          met them on a path they immediately left it, clapped their hands,
          and covering up their heads with their rugs, walked in a stooping
          posture and spoke in whispers until he had gone by. They might not
          talk with him, and when he and they spoke to other people in each
          other's presence, they used a special form of speech which went by
          the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“turn tongue.”</span> This was

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will perhaps
          occur to the reader that customs of this latter sort may possibly
          have originated in the intermarriage of tribes speaking different
          languages; and there are some Australian facts which seem at first
          sight to favour this supposition. Thus with regard to the natives
          of South Australia we are told that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          principal mark of distinction between the tribes is difference of
          language or dialect; where the tribes intermix greatly no
          inconvenience is experienced on this account, as every person
          understands, in addition to his own dialect, that of the
          neighbouring tribe; the consequence is that two persons commonly
          converse in two languages, just as an Englishman and German would
          hold a conversation, each person speaking his own language, but
          understanding that of the other as well as his own. This
          peculiarity will often occur in one family through intermarriages,
          neither party ever thinking of changing his or her dialect for that
          of the other. Children do not always adopt the language of the
          mother, but that of the tribe among whom they live.”</span><a id=

          Among some tribes of western Victoria a man was actually forbidden
          to marry a wife who spoke the same dialect as himself; and during
          the preliminary visit, which each paid to the tribe of the other,
          neither was permitted to speak the language of the tribe which he
          or she was visiting. The children spoke the language of their
          father and might never mix it with any other. To her children the
          mother spoke in their father's language, but to her husband she
          spoke in her own, and he answered her in his; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“so that all conversation is carried on between husband
          and wife in the same way as between an Englishman and a
          Frenchwoman, each speaking his or her own language. This very
          remarkable law explains the preservation of so many distinct
          dialects within so limited a space, even where there are no
          physical obstacles to ready and frequent <span class="tei tei-pb"

          is well known that the Carib women spoke a language which differed

          language of a race of whom the men had been exterminated and the
          women married by the Caribs. This explanation is not, as some seem
          to suppose, a mere hypothesis of the learned, devised to clear up a

          as such it deserves serious attention. But there are other facts

          Among the Carayahis, a tribe of Brazilian Indians on the Rio Grande
          or Araguaya River, the dialect of the women differs from that of
          the men. For the most part the differences are limited to the form
          and sound of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg
          349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          words; only a few words seem to be quite distinct in the two
          dialects. The speech of the women appears to preserve older and
          fuller forms than that of the men: for instance, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“girl”</span> is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">yadokoma</span></span> in the female speech
          but <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">yadôma</span></span> in the male; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“nail”</span> is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">desika</span></span> in the mouth of a woman
          but <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">desia</span></span> in the mouth of a
          man.<a id="noteref_1316" name="noteref_1316" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1316</span></span></a>
          However such remarkable differences are to be explained, a little
          reflection will probably convince us that a mere intermixture of
          races speaking different tongues could scarcely account for the
          phenomena of language under consideration. For the reluctance to
          mention the names or even syllables of the names of persons
          connected with the speaker by marriage can hardly be separated from
          the reluctance evinced by so many people to utter their own names
          or the names of the dead or of chiefs and kings; and if the
          reticence as to these latter names springs mainly from
          superstition, we may infer that the reticence as to the former has
          no better foundation. That the savage's unwillingness to mention
          his own name is based, at least in part, on a superstitious fear of
          the ill use that might be made of it by his foes, whether human or
          spiritual, has already been shewn. It remains to examine the
          similar usage in regard to the names of the dead and of royal
          personages.</p>

          at the present day it is in full force among many savage tribes.
          Thus we are told that one of the customs most rigidly observed and
          enforced amongst the Australian aborigines is never to mention the
          name of a deceased person, whether male or female; to name aloud
          one who has departed this life would be a gross violation of their
          most sacred prejudices, and they carefully abstain from it.<a id=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> fear of evoking the ghost, although the

          Mr. Oldfield so terrified a native by shouting out the name of a
          deceased person, that the man fairly took to his heels and did not
          venture to shew himself again for several days. At their next
          meeting he bitterly reproached the rash white man for his
          indiscretion; <span class="tei tei-q">“nor could I,”</span> adds
          Mr. Oldfield, <span class="tei tei-q">“induce him by any means to
          utter the awful sound of a dead man's name, for by so doing he
          would have placed himself in the power of the malign

          another occasion, a Watchandie woman having mentioned the name of a
          certain man, was informed that he had long been dead. At that she
          became greatly excited and spat thrice to counteract the evil
          effect of having taken a dead man's name into her lips. This custom
          of spitting thrice, as Mr. Oldfield afterwards learned, was the
          regular charm whereby the natives freed themselves from the power
          of the dangerous spirits whom they had provoked by such a rash
          act.<a id="noteref_1321" name="noteref_1321" href=

          Among the aborigines of Victoria the dead were very rarely spoken
          of, and then never by their names; they were referred to in a
          subdued voice as <span class="tei tei-q">“the lost one”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the poor fellow that is no more.”</span>
          To speak of them by name would, it was supposed, excite the

          Amongst the tribes of Central Australia no one may utter the name
          of the deceased during the period of mourning, unless it is
          absolutely necessary to do so, and then it is only done in a
          whisper for fear of disturbing and annoying the man's spirit which
          is walking about in ghostly form. If the ghost hears his name
          mentioned he concludes that his kinsfolk are not mourning for him
          properly; if their grief were genuine they could not bear to bandy
          his name about. Touched to the quick by their hard-hearted
          indifference, the indignant ghost will come and trouble them in

          presence of his nephew or uncle, they will assuredly kill the
          offender on the spot if they can. But if he escapes, the penalty

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar

          the Todas of southern India; the Mongols of Tartary and the Tuaregs

          reason for this avoidance is probably the fear of the ghost. That
          this is the real motive with the Tuaregs of the Sahara we are
          positively informed. They dread the return of the dead man's
          spirit, and do all they can to avoid it by shifting their camp
          after a death, ceasing for ever to pronounce the name of the
          departed, and eschewing everything that might be regarded as an
          evocation or recall of his soul. Hence they do not, like the Arabs,
          designate individuals by adding to their personal names the names
          of their fathers; they never speak of So-and-so, son of So-and-so;
          they give to every man a name which will live and die with

          probably his ghostly namesake was supposed to come and fetch him

          believe that the spirits of the dead pass their time in the forest
          eating unpalatable fruits, are unwilling to mention the names of

          say to a person <span class="tei tei-q">“Your fathers are
          dead,”</span> is considered a direct challenge to fight; it is an
          insult which must be avenged either by the death of the man who
          pronounced these awful words, or by the death of one of his
          relatives or friends. The uttering of the names of the dead is,
          along with homicide, one of the chief causes of war in the island.
          When it is necessary to refer to a dead man they designate him by
          such a phrase as <span class="tei tei-q">“the father of
          So-and-so,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“the brother of

          the fear of mentioning the names of the dead gives rise to
          circumlocutions of precisely the same sort as those which originate
          in a reluctance to name living people. Among the Klallam Indians of
          Washington State no person may bear the name of his deceased
          father, grandfather, or any other direct ancestor in the paternal
          line.<a id="noteref_1340" name="noteref_1340" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1340</span></span></a> The
          Masai of eastern Africa are said to resort to a simple device which
          enables them to speak of the dead freely without risk of the
          inopportune appearance of the ghost. As soon as a man or woman
          dies, they change his or her name, and henceforth always speak of
          him or her by the new name, while the old name falls into oblivion,
          and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name=
          "Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to utter it in the
          presence of a kinsman of the deceased is an insult which calls for
          vengeance. They assume that the dead man will not know his new
          name, and so will not answer to it when he hears it
          pronounced.<a id="noteref_1341" name="noteref_1341" href=

          Ghosts are notoriously dull-witted; nothing is easier than to dupe
          them. However, according to another and more probable account, the
          name of a Masai is not changed after his death; it is merely
          suppressed, and he or she is referred to by a descriptive phrase,
          such as <span class="tei tei-q">“my brother,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“my uncle,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“my
          sister.”</span> To call a dead man by his name is deemed most
          unlucky, and is never done except with the intention of doing harm
          to his surviving family, who make great lamentations on such an
          occasion.<a id="noteref_1342" name="noteref_1342" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same fear of
          the ghost, which moves people to suppress his old name, naturally
          leads all persons who bear a similar name to exchange it for
          another, lest its utterance should attract the attention of the
          ghost, who cannot reasonably be expected to discriminate between
          all the different applications of the same name. Thus we are told
          that in the Adelaide and Encounter Bay tribes of South Australia
          the repugnance to mentioning the names of those who have died
          lately is carried so far, that persons who bear the same name as
          the deceased abandon it, and either adopt temporary names or are

          similar custom prevails among some of the Queensland tribes; but
          the prohibition to use the names of the dead is not permanent,
          though it may last for many years. On the <span class="tei tei-pb"

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Bloomfield River, when a namesake dies, the
          survivor is called Tanyu, a word whose meaning is unknown; or else
          he or she receives a name which refers to the corpse, with the
          syllable Wau prefixed to it. For example, he may be called
          Wau-batcha, with reference to the place where the man was buried;
          or Wau-wotchinyu (<span class="tei tei-q">“burnt”</span>), with
          reference to the cremation of the body. And if there should be
          several people in camp all bearing one of these allusive
          designations, they are distinguished from each other by the mention
          of the names of their mothers or other relatives, even though these
          last have long been dead and gone. Whenever Mr. W. E. Roth, to whom
          we owe this information, could obtain an explanation of the custom,
          the reason invariably assigned was a fear that the ghost, hearing
          himself called by name, might return and cause mischief.<a id=

          some Australian tribes the change of name thus brought about is
          permanent; the old name is laid aside for ever, and the man is
          known by his new name for the rest of his life, or at least until
          he is obliged to change it again for a like reason.<a id=

          Among the North American Indians all persons, whether men or women,
          who bore the name of one who had just died were obliged to abandon
          it and to adopt other names, which was formally done at the first
          ceremony of mourning for the dead.<a id="noteref_1349" name=

          Amongst the Masai also, when two men of the same tribe bear the

          that the sound of the familiar names might lure back the vagrant
          spirit to its old home. Thus in some Victorian tribes the ordinary
          names of all the next of kin were disused during the period of
          mourning, and certain general terms, prescribed by custom, were
          substituted for them. To call a mourner by his own name was

          Among the Kiowa Indians the name of the dead is never spoken in the

          Raleigh's colonists on Roanoke Island more than three centuries

          Among the Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco in South America not
          only is a dead man's name never mentioned, but all the survivors
          change their names also. They say that Death has been among them
          and has carried off a list of the living, and that he will soon
          come back for more victims; hence in order to defeat his fell
          purpose they change their names, believing that on his return
          Death, though he has got them all on his list, will not be able to
          identify them under their new names, and will depart to pursue the
          search elsewhere.<a id="noteref_1356" name="noteref_1356" href=

          wonderful to observe how from that moment everybody remembered his

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further, when
          the name of the deceased happens to be that of some common object,
          such as an animal, or plant, or fire, or water, it is sometimes
          considered necessary to drop that word in ordinary speech and
          replace it by another. A custom of this sort, it is plain, may
          easily be a potent agent of change in language; for where it
          prevails to any considerable extent many words must constantly
          become obsolete and new ones spring up. And this tendency has been
          remarked by observers who have recorded the custom in Australia,
          America, and elsewhere. For example, with regard to the Australian
          aborigines it has been noted that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          dialects change with almost every tribe. Some tribes name their
          children after natural objects; and when the person so named dies,
          the word is never again mentioned; another word has therefore to be
          invented for the object after which the child was called.”</span>
          The writer gives as an instance the case of a man whose name Karla
          signified <span class="tei tei-q">“fire”</span>; when Karla died, a
          new word for fire had to be introduced. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hence,”</span> adds the writer, <span class=

          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">torpool</span></span>; but when a boy called
          Torpool died, a new name (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tilquaitch</span></span>)
          was given to the bird, and the old name dropped out altogether from

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1361</span></span></a>
          Sometimes, however, such substitutes for common words were only in
          vogue for a limited time after the death, and were then discarded
          in favour of the old words. Thus among the Kowraregas of the Prince
          of Wales' Islands and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg
          359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Gudangs of Cape York in Queensland, the names of the dead are
          never mentioned without great reluctance, so that, for example,
          when a man named Us, or quartz, died, the name of the stone was
          changed to <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nattam ure</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the thing which is a namesake,”</span> but the
          original word would gradually return to common use.<a id=

          Again, a missionary, who lived among the Victorian aborigines,
          remarks that <span class="tei tei-q">“it is customary among these
          blacks to disuse a word when a person has died whose name was the
          same, or even of the same sound. I find great difficulty in getting
          blacks to repeat such words. I believe this custom is common to all
          the Victorian tribes, though in course of time the word is resumed
          again. I have seen among the Murray blacks the dead freely spoken
          of when they have been dead some time.”</span><a id="noteref_1363"
          name="noteref_1363" href="#note_1363"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1363</span></span></a>
          Again, in the Encounter Bay tribe of South Australia, if a man of
          the name of Ngnke, which means <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“water,”</span> were to die, the whole tribe would be
          obliged to use some other word to express water for a considerable
          time after his decease. The writer who records this custom surmises
          that it may explain the presence of a number of synonyms in the
          language of the tribe.<a id="noteref_1364" name="noteref_1364"
          href="#note_1364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1364</span></span></a> This
          conjecture is confirmed by what we know of some Victorian tribes
          whose speech comprised a regular set of synonyms to be used instead
          of the common terms by all members of a tribe in times of mourning.
          For instance, if a man called Waa (<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“crow”</span>) departed this life, during the period of
          mourning for him nobody might call a crow a <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">waa</span></span>; everybody had to speak of
          the bird as a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">narrapart</span></span>. When a person who
          rejoiced in the title of Ringtail Opossum (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">weearn</span></span>) had gone the way of all
          flesh, his sorrowing relations and the tribe at large were bound
          for a time to refer to ringtail opossums by the more sonorous name
          of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">manuungkuurt</span></span>. If the community
          were plunged in grief for the loss of a respected female who bore
          the honourable name of Turkey Bustard, the proper name for turkey
          bustards, which was <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">barrim barrim</span></span>, went out, and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar custom
          used to be constantly transforming the language of the Abipones of
          Paraguay, amongst whom, however, a word once abolished seems never
          to have been revived. New words, says the missionary Dobrizhoffer,
          sprang up every year like mushrooms in a night, because all words
          that resembled the names of the dead were abolished by proclamation
          and others coined in their place. The mint of words was in the
          hands of the old women of the tribe, and whatever term they stamped
          with their approval and put in circulation was immediately accepted
          without a murmur by high and low alike, and spread like wildfire
          through every camp and settlement of the tribe. You would be
          astonished, says the same missionary, to see how meekly the whole
          nation acquiesces in the decision of a withered old hag, and how
          completely the old familiar words fall instantly out of use and are
          never repeated either through force of habit or forgetfulness. In
          the seven years that Dobrizhoffer spent among these Indians the
          native word for jaguar was changed thrice, and the words for
          crocodile, thorn, and the slaughter of cattle underwent similar
          though less varied vicissitudes. As a result of this habit, the
          vocabularies of the missionaries teemed with erasures, old words
          having constantly to be struck out as obsolete and new ones
          inserted in their place.<a id="noteref_1366" name="noteref_1366"

          Similarly, a peculiar feature of the Comanche language is that a
          portion of the vocabulary is continually changing. If, for example,
          a person called Eagle or Bison dies, a new name is invented for the
          bird or beast, because it is forbidden to mention the name of any
          one who is dead.<a id="noteref_1367" name="noteref_1367" href=

          amongst the Kiowa Indians all words that suggest the name of a
          deceased person are dropped for a term of years and other words
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name=
          "Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> are substituted for
          them. The old word may after the lapse of years be restored, but it
          often happens that the new one keeps its place and the original
          word is entirely forgotten. Old men sometimes remember as many as
          three different names which have been successively used for the
          same thing. The new word is commonly a novel combination of
          existing roots, or a novel use of a current word, rather than a
          deliberately invented term.<a id="noteref_1368" name="noteref_1368"

          this statement, which is translated from a native account in the
          Masai language, we may perhaps infer that among the Masai it is as
          a rule only the childless dead whose names are avoided. In the
          island of Buru it is unlawful to mention the names of the dead or
          any words that resemble them in sound.<a id="noteref_1371" name=

          many tribes of British New Guinea the names of persons are also the
          names of common things. The people believe that if the name of a
          deceased person is pronounced, his spirit will return, and as they
          have no wish to see it back among them the mention of his name is
          tabooed and a new word <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg
          362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          is created to take its place, whenever the name happens to be a
          common term of the language.<a id="noteref_1372" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1372</span></span></a> Thus
          at Waga-waga, near the south-eastern extremity of New Guinea, the
          names of the dead become taboo immediately after death, and if they
          are, as generally happens, the names of common objects, new words
          must be adopted for these things and the old words are dropped from
          the language, so long at least as the memory of the dead survives.
          For example, when a man died whose name Binama meant <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“hornbill,”</span> a new name <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ambadina</span></span>, literally <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the plasterer,”</span> was adopted for the bird.
          Consequently many words are permanently lost or revived with
          modified or new meanings. The frequent changes of vocabulary caused
          by this custom are very inconvenient, and nowadays the practice of
          using foreign words as substitutes is coming more and more into
          vogue. English profanity now contributes its share to the language
          of these savages.<a id="noteref_1373" name="noteref_1373" href=

          effectually hinder the <span class="tei tei-q">‘making of
          history,’</span> or, at any rate, the transmission of historical
          narrative. By a strict rule, which has all the sanction of Nicobar
          superstition, no man's name may be mentioned after his death! To
          such a length is this carried that when, as very frequently
          happens, the man rejoiced in the name of <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Fire,’</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Road,’</span> etc., in its Nicobarese equivalent, the
          use of these words is carefully eschewed for the future, not only
          as being the personal designation of the deceased, but even as the
          names <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name=
          "Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the common things
          they represent; the words die out of the language, and either new
          vocables are coined to express the thing intended, or a substitute
          for the disused word is found in other Nicobarese dialects or in
          some foreign tongue. This extraordinary custom not only adds an
          element of instability to the language, but destroys the continuity
          of political life, and renders the record of past events precarious

          Among some of the tribes of New South Wales the simple ditties,
          never more than two lines long, to which the natives dance, are

          short space of time indeed. This custom of endeavouring
          persistently to forget everything which had been in any way
          connected with the dead entirely precludes the possibility of
          anything of an historical nature having existence amongst them; in

              <span style="font-size: 80%">Sometimes the names of the dead

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In many tribes,
          however, the power of this superstition to blot out the memory of
          the past is to some extent weakened and impaired by a natural
          tendency of the human mind. Time, which wears out the deepest
          impressions, inevitably dulls, if it does not wholly efface, the
          print left on the savage mind by the mystery and horror of death.
          Sooner or later, as the memory of his loved ones fades slowly away,
          he becomes more willing to speak of them, and thus their rude names
          may sometimes be rescued by the philosophic enquirer before they
          have vanished, like autumn leaves or winter snows, into the vast
          undistinguished limbo of the past. This was Sir George Grey's
          experience when he attempted to trace the intricate system of
          kinship prevalent among the natives of western Australia. He says:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“It is impossible for any person, not well
          acquainted with the language of the natives, and who does not
          possess great personal influence over them, to pursue an inquiry of
          this nature; for one of the customs most rigidly observed and
          enforced amongst them is, never to mention the name of a deceased
          person, male or female. In an inquiry, therefore, which principally
          turns upon the names of their ancestors, this prejudice must be
          every moment violated, and a very great difficulty encountered in
          the outset. The only circumstance which at all enabled me to
          overcome this was, that the longer a person has been dead the less
          repugnance do they evince in uttering his name. I, therefore, in
          the first instance, endeavoured to ascertain only the oldest names
          on record; and on subsequent occasions, when I found a native
          alone, and in a loquacious humour, I succeeded in filling up some
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name=
          "Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the blanks.
          Occasionally, round their fires at night, I managed to involve them
          in disputes regarding their ancestors, and, on these occasions,
          gleaned much of the information of which I was in

          Similarly the Jesuit missionary Lafitau tells us that the name of
          the departed and the similar names of the survivors were, so to
          say, buried with the corpse until, the poignancy of their grief
          being abated, it pleased the relations to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“lift up the tree and raise the dead.”</span> By
          raising the dead they meant bestowing the name of the departed upon
          some one else, who thus became to all intents and purposes a
          reincarnation of the deceased, since on the principles of savage
          philosophy the name is a vital part, if not the soul, of the man.
          When Father Lafitau arrived at St. Louis to begin work among the
          Iroquois, his colleagues decided that in order to make a favourable
          impression on his flock the new shepherd should assume the native
          name of his deceased predecessor, Father <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Brüyas, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          celebrated missionary,”</span> who had lived many years among the
          Indians and enjoyed their high esteem. But Father Brüyas had been
          called from his earthly labours to his heavenly rest only four
          short months before, and it was too soon, in the phraseology of the
          Iroquois, to <span class="tei tei-q">“raise up the tree.”</span>
          However, raised up it was in spite of them; and though some bolder
          spirits protested that their new pastor had wronged them by taking
          the name of his predecessor, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“nevertheless,”</span> says Father Lafitau,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“they did not fail to regard me as himself

          of Canada. An early French traveller in Canada has described the
          ceremony of resurrection as it was observed by a tribe whom he
          calls the Attiuoindarons. He says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          Attiuoindarons practise resurrections of the dead, principally of
          persons who have deserved well of their country by their remarkable
          services, so that the memory of illustrious and valiant men revives
          in a certain way in others. Accordingly they call assemblies for
          this purpose and hold councils, at which they choose one of them
          who has the same virtues and qualities, if possible, as he had whom
          they wish to resuscitate; or at least he must be of irreproachable
          life, judged by the standard of a savage people. Wishing, then, to
          proceed to the resurrection they all stand up, except him who is to
          be resuscitated, to whom they give the name of the deceased, and
          all letting their hands down very low they pretend to lift him up
          from the earth, intending by that to signify that they draw the
          great personage deceased from the grave and restore him to life in
          the person of this other, who stands up and, after great
          acclamations of the people, receives the presents which the
          bystanders offer him. They further hold several feasts in his
          honour and regard him thenceforth as the deceased whom he

          Among the Hurons the ceremony took place between the death and the
          great Festival of the Dead, which was usually celebrated at
          intervals of twelve years. When it was resolved to resuscitate a
          departed warrior, the members of his family met and decided which
          of them was to be regarded as an incarnation of the deceased. If
          the dead man had been a famous chief and leader in war, his living
          representative and namesake succeeded to his functions. Presents
          were made to him, and he entertained the whole tribe at a
          magnificent banquet. His old robes were taken from him, and he was
          clad in richer raiment. Thereupon a herald proclaimed aloud the
          mystery of the incarnation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let all the
          people,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“remain silent.
          Open your ears and shut your mouths. That which I am about to say
          is of importance. Our business is to resuscitate a dead man and to
          bring a great captain to life again.”</span> With that he named the
          dead man and all his posterity, and reminded his hearers of the
          place and manner of his death. Then turning to him who was to
          succeed the departed, he lifted up his voice: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold him,”</span> he cried, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“clad in this beautiful robe. It is not he whom you saw
          these past days, who was called Nehap. He has given his name to
          another, and he himself is now called Etouait”</span> (the name of
          the defunct). <span class="tei tei-q">“Look on him as the true
          captain of this nation. It is he whom you are bound to obey; it is
          he whom you are bound to listen to; it is he whom you are bound to
          honour.”</span> The new incarnation meanwhile maintained a
          dignified silence, and afterwards led the young braves out to war
          in order to prove that he had inherited the courage and virtues as
          well as the name of the dead chief.<a id="noteref_1386" name=

          the pile of wood on which a corpse is laid, a <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> relation of the deceased person stands
          at his feet, and asks him if he will ever come back among them.
          Then the priest or magician, with a grave countenance, stands at
          the head of the corpse, and looks through both his hands on its
          naked breast, and then raises them toward heaven, and blows through
          them, as they say, the soul of the deceased, that it may go and
          find, and enter into a relative. Or, if any relative is present,
          the priest will hold both his hands on the head of this person, and
          blow through them, that the spirit of the deceased may enter into
          him or her; and then, as they affirm, the first child which this
          person has will possess the soul of the deceased
          person.”</span><a id="noteref_1387" name="noteref_1387" href=

          writer does not say that the infant took the name of the deceased
          who was born again in it; but probably it did. For sometimes the

          in that case took the name of the departed in addition to his

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Lapps,

          a dream and inform her what dead person was to be born again in her
          infant, and whose name the child was therefore to bear. If the
          woman had no such dream, it fell to the father or the relatives to

          Among the Khonds a birth is celebrated on the seventh day after the
          event by a feast given to the priest and to the whole village. To
          determine the child's name the priest drops grains of rice into a
          cup of water, naming with each grain a deceased ancestor. From the
          movements of the seed in the water, and from observations made on
          the person of the infant, he pronounces which of his progenitors
          has reappeared in him, and the child generally, at least
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name=

          Among the Ewe-speaking peoples of Togo, in West Africa, when a
          woman is in hard labour, a fetish priest or priestess is called in
          to disclose the name of the deceased relative who has just been
          born again into the world in the person of the infant. The name of
          that relative is bestowed on the child.<a id="noteref_1391" name=

          Among the Yorubas, soon after a child has been born, a priest of
          Ifa, the god of divination, appears on the scene to ascertain what
          ancestral soul has been reborn in the infant. As soon as this has
          been decided, the parents are told that the child must conform in
          all respects to the manner of life of the ancestor who now animates
          him or her, and if, as often happens, they profess ignorance, the
          priest supplies the necessary information. The child usually
          receives the name of the ancestor who has been born again in
          him.<a id="noteref_1392" name="noteref_1392" href=

          Uganda a child is named with much ceremony by its grandfather, who
          bestows on it the name of one of its ancestors, but never the name

          child and assists him through life.<a id="noteref_1393" name=

          the reincarnation of the ancestor appears to be effected by giving
          his name, and with it his soul, to his descendant. The same idea
          seems to explain a curious ceremony observed by the Makalaka of
          South Africa at the naming of a child. The spirit of the ancestor
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">motsimo</span></span>), whose name the child
          is to bear, is represented by an elderly kinsman or kinswoman,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name=
          "Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> according as the
          little one is a boy or a girl. A pretence is made of catching the
          representative of the spirit, and dragging him or her to the hut of
          the child's parents. Outside the hut the pretended spirit takes his
          seat and the skin of an animal is thrown over him. He then washes
          his hands in a vessel of water, eats some millet-porridge, and
          washes it down with beer. Meantime the women and girls dance
          gleefully round him, screaming or singing, and throw copper rings,
          beads, and so forth as presents into the vessel of water. The men
          do the same, but without dancing; after that they enter the hut to
          partake of a feast. The representative of the ancestral spirit now
          vanishes, and the child thenceforth bears his or her name.<a id=

          honour. The day before the great feast of the dead the nearest male
          relative of the deceased goes to the grave and plants before it a
          stake bearing the crest or badge of the departed. This is the

          some Indian tribes on the north-west coast of America it is said

          the Encounter Bay tribe of the same country the dead body is dried
          over a fire, packed up in mats, and carried about for several
          months among the scenes which had been familiar to the deceased in
          his life. Next it is placed on a platform of sticks and left there
          till it has completely decayed, whereupon the next of kin takes the
          skull and uses it as a drinking-cup. After that the name of the
          departed may be uttered without offence. Were it pronounced sooner

          rule that the name of the dead may not be spoken until his body has
          mouldered away seems to point to a belief that the spirit continues
          to exist only so long as the body does so, and that, when the
          material frame is dissolved, the spiritual part of the man perishes
          with it, or goes away, or at least becomes so feeble and incapable

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> by the practice of the Arunta tribe in
          central Australia. We have seen that among them no one may mention
          the name of the deceased during the period of mourning for fear of
          disturbing and annoying the ghost, who is believed to be walking
          about at large. Some of the relations of the dead man, it is true,
          such as his parents, elder brothers and sisters, paternal aunts,
          mother-in-law, and all his sons-in-law, whether actual or possible,
          are debarred all their lives from taking his name into their lips;
          but other people, including his wife, children, grandchildren,
          grandparents, younger brothers and sisters, and father-in-law, are
          free to name him so soon as he has ceased to walk the earth and
          hence to be dangerous. Some twelve or eighteen months after his
          death the people seem to think that the dead man has enjoyed his
          liberty long enough, and that it is time to confine his restless
          spirit within narrower bounds. Accordingly a grand battue or
          ghost-hunt brings the days of mourning to an end. The favourite
          haunt of the deceased is believed to be the burnt and deserted camp
          where he died. Here therefore on a certain day a band of men and
          women, the men armed with shields and spear-throwers, assemble and
          begin dancing round the charred and blackened remains of the camp,
          shouting and beating the air with their weapons and hands in order
          to drive away the lingering spirit from the spot he loves too well.
          When the dancing is over, the whole party proceed to the grave at a
          run, chasing the ghost before them. It is in vain that the unhappy
          ghost makes a last bid for freedom, and, breaking away from the
          beaters, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg
          374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          doubles back towards the camp; the leader of the party is prepared
          for this manœuvre, and by making a long circuit adroitly cuts off
          the retreat of the fugitive. Finally, having run him to earth, they
          trample him down into the grave, dancing and stamping on the
          heaped-up soil, while with downward thrusts through the air they
          beat and force him under ground. There, lying in his narrow house,
          flattened and prostrate under a load of earth, the poor ghost sees
          his widow wearing the gay feathers of the ring-neck parrot in her
          hair, and he knows that the time of her mourning for him is over.
          The loud shouts of the men and women shew him that they are not to
          be frightened and bullied by him any more, and that he had better
          lie quiet. But he may still watch over his friends, and guard them
          from harm, and visit them in dreams.<a id="noteref_1404" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we see that
          in primitive society the names of mere commoners, whether alive or
          dead, are matters of such anxious care, we need not be surprised
          that great precautions should be taken to guard from harm the names
          of sacred kings and priests. Thus the name of the king of Dahomey
          is always kept secret, lest the knowledge of it should enable some
          evil-minded person to do him a mischief. The appellations by which
          the different kings of Dahomey have been known to Europeans are not
          their true names, but mere titles, or what the natives call
          <span class="tei tei-q">“strong names”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nyi-sese</span></span>). As a rule, these
          <span class="tei tei-q">“strong names”</span> are the first words
          of sentences descriptive of certain qualities. Thus Agaja, the name
          by which the fourth king of the dynasty was known, was part of a
          sentence meaning, <span class="tei tei-q">“A spreading tree must be
          lopped before it can be cast into the fire”</span>; and Tegbwesun,
          the name of the fifth king, formed the first word of a sentence
          which signified, <span class="tei tei-q">“No one can take the cloth
          off the neck of a wild bull.”</span> The natives seem to think that
          no harm comes of such titles being known, since they are not, like
          the birth-names, vitally connected with their owners.<a id=

          Among the Bahima of central Africa, when the king dies, his name is
          abolished from the language, and if his name was that of an animal,
          a new appellation must be found for the creature at once. For
          example, the king is often called a lion; hence at the death of a
          king named Lion a new name for lions in general has to be
          coined.<a id="noteref_1407" name="noteref_1407" href=

          "font-style: italic">mpologoma</span></span>. But when a prominent
          chief of that name died, the word for lion was changed to
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kichunchu</span></span>. Again, in the Bahima
          language the word for <span class="tei tei-q">“nine”</span> used to
          be <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mwenda</span></span>, a word which occurs with
          the same meaning but dialectical variations in the languages of
          other tribes of central and eastern Africa. But when a chief who
          bore the name Mwenda died, the old name for <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“nine”</span> had to be changed, and accordingly the
          word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">langa</span></span> to <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gala</span></span>, and so remains to this
          day, though Langa died more than a hundred years ago. Once more, in
          the Xnumayo tribe the word meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“to herd
          cattle”</span> was changed from <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">alusa</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ayusa</span></span> to <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kagesa</span></span>, because u-Mayusi was the
          name of the chief. Besides these taboos, which were observed by
          each tribe separately, all the Zulu tribes united in tabooing the
          name of the king who reigned over the whole nation. Hence, for
          example, when Panda was king of Zululand, the word for <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“a root of a tree,”</span> which is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">impando</span></span>, was changed to
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nxabo</span></span>. Again, the word for
          <span class="tei tei-q">“lies”</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“slander”</span> was altered from <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">amacebo</span></span> to <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">amakwata</span></span>, because <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">amacebo</span></span> contains a syllable of
          the name of the famous King Cetchwayo. These substitutions are not,
          however, carried so far by the men as by the women, who omit every
          sound even remotely resembling one that occurs in a tabooed name.
          At the king's kraal, indeed, it is sometimes difficult to
          understand the speech of the royal wives, as they treat in this
          fashion the names not only of the king and his forefathers, but
          even of his and their brothers back for generations. When to these
          tribal and national taboos we add those family taboos on the names
          of connexions by marriage which have been already described,<a id=
          "noteref_1418" name="noteref_1418" href="#note_1418"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1418</span></span></a> we
          can easily understand how it comes about that in Zululand every
          tribe has words peculiar to itself, and that the women have a
          considerable vocabulary of their own. Members, too, of one family
          may be debarred from using words employed by those of another. The
          women of one kraal, for instance, may call a hyaena by its ordinary
          name; those of the next may use the common substitute; while in a
          third the substitute may also be unlawful and another term may have
          to be invented to supply its place. Hence the Zulu language at the
          present day almost presents the appearance of being a double one;
          indeed, for multitudes of things it possesses three or four
          synonyms, which through the blending of tribes are known all over
          Zululand.<a id="noteref_1419" name="noteref_1419" href=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Madagascar a
          similar custom everywhere prevails and has resulted, as among the
          Zulus, in producing certain dialectic differences in the speech of
          the various tribes. There are no family names in Madagascar, and
          almost every personal name is drawn from the language of daily life
          and signifies some common object or action or quality, such as a
          bird, a beast, a tree, a plant, a colour, and so on. Now, whenever
          one of these common words forms the name or part of the name of the
          chief of the tribe, it becomes sacred and may no longer be used in
          its ordinary signification as the name of a tree, an insect, or
          what not. Hence a new name for the object must be invented to
          replace the one which has been discarded. Often the new name
          consists of a descriptive epithet or a periphrasis. Thus when the
          princess Rabodo became queen in 1863 she took the name of
          Rasoherina. Now <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">soherina</span></span> was the word for the
          silkworm moth, but having been assumed as the name of the sovereign
          it could no longer be applied to the insect, which ever since has
          been called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">zany-dandy</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“offspring of silk.”</span> So, again, if a chief had
          or took the name of an animal, say of the dog (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">amboa</span></span>), and was known as Ramboa,
          the animal would henceforth be called by another name, probably a
          descriptive one, such as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          barker”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">famovo</span></span>) or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the driver away”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">fandroaka</span></span>), etc. In the western
          part of Imerina there was a chief called Andria-mamba; but
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mamba</span></span> was one of the names of
          the crocodile, so the chiefs subjects might not call the reptile by
          that name and were always scrupulous to use another. It is easy to
          conceive what confusion and uncertainty may thus be introduced into
          a language when it is spoken by many little local tribes each ruled
          by a petty chief with his own sacred name. Yet there are tribes and
          people who submit to this tyranny of words as their fathers did
          before them from time immemorial. The inconvenient results of the
          custom are especially marked on the western coast of the island,
          where, on account of the large number of independent chieftains,
          the names of things, places, and rivers have suffered so many
          changes that confusion often arises, for when once common words
          have been banned by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg
          379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is not
          merely the names of living kings and chiefs which are tabooed in
          Madagascar; the names of dead sovereigns are equally under a ban,
          at least in some parts of the island. Thus among the Sakalavas,
          when a king has died, the nobles and people meet in council round
          the dead body and solemnly choose a new name by which the deceased
          monarch shall be henceforth known. The new name always begins with
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">andrian</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“lord,”</span> and ends with <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">arrivou</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“thousand,”</span> to signify that the late king ruled
          over a numerous nation. The body of the name is composed of an
          epithet or phrase descriptive of the deceased or of his reign.
          After the new name has been adopted, the old name by which the king
          was known during his life becomes sacred and may not be pronounced
          under pain of death. Further, words in the common language which
          bear any resemblance to the forbidden name also become sacred and
          have to be replaced by others. For example, after the death of King
          Makka the word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">laka</span></span>, which meant a canoe, was
          abandoned and the word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">fiounrâma</span></span> substituted for it.
          When Taoussi died, the word <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">taoussi</span></span>, signifying <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“beautiful,”</span> was replaced by <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">senga</span></span>. For similar reasons the
          word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ântétsi</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“old,”</span> was changed for <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">matoué</span></span>, which properly means
          <span class="tei tei-q">“ripe”</span>; the word <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">voûssi</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“castrated,”</span> was dropped and <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">manapaka</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“cut,”</span> adopted in its place; and the word for
          island (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nossi</span></span>) was changed into
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">varioû</span></span>, which signifies strictly
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a place where there is rice.”</span>
          Again, when a Sakalava king named Marentoetsa died, two words fell
          into disuse, namely, the word <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">màry</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">màre</span></span> meaning <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“true,”</span> and the word <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">toetsa</span></span> meaning <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“condition.”</span> Persons who uttered these forbidden
          words were looked on not only as grossly rude, but even as felons;
          they had committed a capital crime. However, these changes of
          vocabulary are confined to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> district over which the deceased king
          reigned; in the neighbouring districts the old words continue to be

          Again, among the Bara, another tribe of Madagascar, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the memory of their deceased kings is held in the very
          highest respect; the name of such kings is considered sacred—too
          sacred indeed for utterance, and no one is allowed to pronounce it.
          To such a length is this absurdity carried that the name of any
          person or thing whatsoever, if it bear a resemblance to the name of
          the deceased king, is no longer used, but some other designation is
          given. For instance, there was a king named Andriamasoandro. After
          his decease the word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">masoandro</span></span> was no longer employed
          as the name of the sun, but <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mahenika</span></span> was substituted for
          it.”</span><a id="noteref_1422" name="noteref_1422" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1422</span></span></a> An
          eminent authority on Madagascar has observed: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A curious fact, which has had a very marked influence
          on the Malagasy language, is the custom of no longer pronouncing
          the name of a dead person nor even the words which resemble it in
          their conclusions. The name is replaced by another. King Ramitra,
          since his decease, has been called Mahatenatenarivou, 'the prince
          who has conquered a thousand foes,' and a Malagasy who should utter
          his old name would be regarded as the murderer of the prince, and
          would therefore be liable to the confiscation of his property, or
          even to the penalty of death. It is easy accordingly to understand
          how the Malagasy language, one in its origin, has been corrupted,
          and how it comes about that at the present day there are
          discrepancies between the various dialects. In Menabe, since the
          death of King Vinany, the word <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">vilany</span></span>, meaning a pot, has been
          replaced by <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">fiketrehane</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘cooking vessel,’</span> whereas the old word continues
          in use in the rest of Madagascar. These changes, it <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is true, hardly take place except for

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sanctity
          attributed to the persons of chiefs in Polynesia naturally extended
          also to their names, which on the primitive view are hardly
          separable from the personality of their owners. Hence in Polynesia
          we find the same systematic prohibition to utter the names of
          chiefs or of common words resembling them which we have already met
          with in Zululand and Madagascar. Thus in New Zealand the name of a
          chief is held so sacred that, when it happens to be a common word,
          it may not be used in the language, and another has to be found to
          replace it. For example, a chief to the southward of East Cape bore
          the name of Maripi, which signified a knife, hence a new word
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nekra</span></span>) for knife was introduced,
          and the old one became obsolete. Elsewhere the word for water
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">wai</span></span>) had to be changed, because
          it chanced to be the name of the chief, and would have been
          desecrated by being applied to the vulgar fluid as well as to his
          sacred person. This taboo naturally produced a plentiful crop of
          synonyms in the Maori language, and travellers newly arrived in the
          country were sometimes puzzled at finding the same things called by
          quite different names in neighbouring tribes.<a id="noteref_1424"

          a king comes to the throne in Tahiti, any words in the language
          that resemble his name in sound must be changed for others. In
          former times, if any man were so rash as to disregard this custom
          and to use the forbidden words, not only he but all his relations
          were immediately put to death.<a id="noteref_1425" name=

          as forty or fifty of the commonest words in the language, and every
          native was obliged to adopt the new terms, for any neglect
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name=

          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tiai</span></span>, and so on. Sometimes, as
          in these instances, the new names were formed by merely changing or
          dropping some letter or letters of the original words; in other
          cases the substituted terms were entirely different words, whether
          chosen for their similarity of meaning though not of sound, or
          adopted from another dialect, or arbitrarily invented. But the
          changes thus introduced were only temporary; on the death of the
          king the new words fell into disuse, and the original ones were
          revived.<a id="noteref_1427" name="noteref_1427" href=

          Similarly in Samoa, when the name of a sacred chief was that of an
          animal or bird, the name of the animal or bird was at once changed
          for another, and the old one might never again be uttered in that
          chief's district. For example, a sacred Samoan chief was named
          Pe'a, which means <span class="tei tei-q">“flying-fox.”</span>
          Hence in his district a flying-fox was no longer called a
          flying-fox but a <span class="tei tei-q">“bird of heaven”</span>

          of the rites of the Navajo Indians may be celebrated only in

          underground cannot hear the stories in which their names are made

          a circle of eager listeners, the narrative being broken from time
          to time with a song in which the hearers join. The telling of these
          stories is believed to promote the growth of the crops. Hence each

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia the superstition about names
          has affected in a very curious way the social structure of the
          tribe. The nobles have two different sets of names, one for use in
          winter and the other in summer. Their winter names are those which
          were given them at initiation by their guardian spirits, and as
          these spirits appear to their devotees only in winter, the names
          which they bestowed on the Indians may not be pronounced in summer.
          Conversely the summer names may not be used in winter. The change
          from summer to winter names takes place from the moment when the
          spirits are supposed to be present, and it involves a complete
          transformation of the social system; for whereas during summer the
          people are grouped in clans, in winter they are grouped in
          societies, each society consisting of all persons who have been
          initiated by the same spirit and have received from him the same
          magical powers. Thus among these Indians the fundamental
          constitution of society changes with the seasons: in summer it is
          organised on a basis of kin, in winter on a basis of spiritual
          affinity: for one half the year it is civil, for the other half
          religious.<a id="noteref_1440" name="noteref_1440" href=

          creates his gods in his own image. Xenophanes remarked long ago
          that the complexion of negro gods was black and their noses flat;
          that Thracian gods were ruddy and blue-eyed; and that if horses,
          oxen, and lions only believed in gods and had hands wherewith to
          portray them, they would doubtless fashion their deities in the
          form of horses, and oxen, and lions.<a id="noteref_1441" name=

          Hence just as the furtive savage conceals his real name because he
          fears that sorcerers might make an evil use of it, so he fancies
          that his gods must likewise keep their true names secret, lest
          other gods or even men should learn the mystic sounds and thus be
          able to conjure with them. Nowhere was this crude conception of the
          secrecy and magical virtue of the divine name more firmly held or
          more fully developed than in ancient Egypt, where the superstitions
          of a dateless past were embalmed in the hearts of the people hardly
          less effectually than the bodies of cats and crocodiles and the
          rest of the divine menagerie in their rock-cut tombs. The
          conception is well illustrated by a story which tells how the
          subtle Isis wormed his secret name from Ra, the great Egyptian god
          of the sun. Isis, so runs the tale, was a woman mighty in words,
          and she was weary of the world of men, and yearned after the world
          of the gods. And she meditated in her heart, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Cannot I by virtue of the great name of Ra make myself
          a goddess and reign like him in heaven and earth?”</span> For Ra
          had many names, but the great name which gave him all power over
          gods and men was known to none but himself. Now the god was by this
          time grown old; he slobbered at the mouth and his spittle fell upon
          the ground. So Isis gathered up the spittle and the earth with it,
          and kneaded thereof a serpent and laid it in the path where the
          great god passed every day to his double kingdom after his heart's
          desire. And when he came forth according to his wont, attended by
          all his company of gods, the sacred serpent <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> stung him, and the god opened his mouth
          and cried, and his cry went up to heaven. And the company of gods
          cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“What aileth thee?”</span> and the
          gods shouted, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lo and behold!”</span> But
          he could not answer; his jaws rattled, his limbs shook, the poison
          ran through his flesh as the Nile floweth over the land. When the
          great god had stilled his heart, he cried to his followers,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Come to me, O my children, offspring of my
          body. I am a prince, the son of a prince, the divine seed of a god.
          My father devised my name; my father and my mother gave me my name,
          and it remained hidden in my body since my birth, that no magician
          might have magic power over me. I went out to behold that which I
          have made, I walked in the two lands which I have created, and lo!
          something stung me. What it was, I know not. Was it fire? was it
          water? My heart is on fire, my flesh trembleth, all my limbs do
          quake. Bring me the children of the gods with healing words and
          understanding lips, whose power reacheth to heaven.”</span> Then
          came to him the children of the gods, and they were very sorrowful.
          And Isis came with her craft, whose mouth is full of the breath of
          life, whose spells chase pain away, whose word maketh the dead to
          live. She said, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is it, divine Father?
          what is it?”</span> The holy god opened his mouth, he spake and
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I went upon my way, I walked after
          my heart's desire in the two regions which I have made to behold
          that which I have created, and lo! a serpent that I saw not stung
          me. Is it fire? is it water? I am colder than water, I am hotter
          than fire, all my limbs sweat, I tremble, mine eye is not
          steadfast, I behold not the sky, the moisture bedeweth my face as
          in summer-time.”</span> Then spake Isis, <span class=

          Khepera in the morning, I am Ra at noon, I am Tum at eve.”</span>
          But the poison was not taken away from him; it pierced deeper, and
          the great god could no longer walk. Then said Isis to him,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“That was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class=

          tell it me, that the poison may depart; for he shall live whose
          name is named.”</span> Now the poison burned like fire, it was
          hotter than the flame of fire. The god said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I consent that Isis shall search into me, and that my
          name shall pass from my breast into hers.”</span> Then the god hid
          himself from the gods, and his place in the ship of eternity was
          empty. Thus was the name of the great god taken from him, and Isis,
          the witch, spake, <span class="tei tei-q">“Flow away poison, depart
          from Ra. It is I, even I, who overcome the poison and cast it to
          the earth; for the name of the great god hath been taken away from
          him. Let Ra live and let the poison die.”</span> Thus spake great
          Isis, the queen of the gods, she who knows Ra and his true
          name.<a id="noteref_1442" name="noteref_1442" href=

              <span style="font-size: 80%">Egyptian wizards have worked
              enchantments by the names of the gods both in ancient and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we see that
          the real name of the god, with which his power was inextricably
          bound up, was supposed to be lodged, in an almost physical sense,
          somewhere in his breast, from which it could be extracted by a sort
          of surgical operation and transferred with all its supernatural
          powers to the breast of another. In Egypt attempts like that of
          Isis to appropriate the power of a high god by possessing herself
          of his name were not mere legends told of the mythical beings of a
          remote past; every Egyptian magician aspired to wield like powers
          by similar means. For it was believed that he who possessed the
          true name possessed the very being of god or man, and could force
          even a deity to obey him as a slave obeys his master. Thus the art
          of the magician consisted in obtaining from the gods a revelation
          of their sacred names, and he left no stone unturned to accomplish
          his end. When once a god in a moment of weakness or forgetfulness
          had imparted to the wizard the wondrous lore, the deity had no
          choice but to submit humbly to the man or pay the penalty of his
          contumacy.<a id="noteref_1443" name="noteref_1443" href=

          hear me”</span>; and in another the magician threatens Osiris that
          if the god does not do his bidding he will name him aloud in the
          port of Busiris.<a id="noteref_1444" name="noteref_1444" href=

          in the Lucan the Thessalian witch whom Sextus Pompeius consulted

          modern Egypt the magician still works his old enchantments by the
          same ancient means; only the name of the god by which he conjures
          is different. The man who knows <span class="tei tei-q">“the most
          great name”</span> of God can, we are told, by the mere utterance
          of it kill the living, raise the dead, transport himself instantly
          wherever he pleases, and perform any other miracle.<a id=

          Similarly among the Arabs of North Africa at the present day
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the power of the name is such that when
          one knows the proper names the jinn can scarcely help answering the
          call and obeying; they are the servants of the magical names; in
          this case the incantation has a constraining quality which is for
          the most part very strongly marked. When Ibn el Hâdjdj et-Tlemsânî
          relates how the jinn yielded up their secrets to him, he says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘I once met the seven kings of the jinn in
          a cave and I asked them to teach me the way in which they attack
          men and women, causing them to fall sick, smiting them, paralysing
          them, and the like. They all answered me: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“If it were anybody but you we would teach that to
          nobody, but you have discovered the bonds, the spells, and the
          names which compel us; were it not for the names by which you have
          constrained us, we would not have answered to your

          too, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Chinese of ancient times were
          dominated by the notion that beings are intimately associated with
          their names, so that a man's knowledge of the name of a spectre

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The belief in
          the magic virtue of divine names was shared by the Romans. When
          they sat down before a city, the priests addressed the guardian
          deity of the place in a set form of prayer or incantation, inviting
          him to abandon the beleaguered city and come over to the Romans,
          who would treat him as well as or better than he had ever been
          treated in his old home. Hence the name of the guardian deity of
          Rome was kept a profound secret, lest the enemies of the republic
          might lure him away, even as the Romans themselves had induced many
          gods to desert, like rats, the falling fortunes of cities that had
          sheltered them in happier days.<a id="noteref_1449" name=

          the real name, not merely of its guardian deity, but of the city
          itself, was wrapt in mystery and might never be uttered, not even
          in the sacred rites. A certain Valerius Soranus, who dared to
          divulge the priceless secret, was put to death or came to a bad

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But personal
          names are not the only words which superstitious fears have
          banished from everyday use. In many cases similar motives forbid
          certain persons at certain times to call common things by common
          names, thus obliging them either to refrain from mentioning these
          things altogether or to designate them by special terms or phrases
          reserved for such occasions. A consideration of these cases follows
          naturally on an examination of the taboos imposed upon personal
          names; for personal names are themselves very often ordinary terms
          of the language, so that an embargo laid on them necessarily
          extends to many expressions current in the commerce of daily life.
          And though a survey of some of the interdicts on common words is
          not strictly necessary for our immediate purpose, it may serve
          usefully to complete our view of the transforming influence which
          superstition has exercised on language. I shall make no attempt to
          subject the examples to a searching analysis or a rigid
          classification, but will set them down as they come in a rough
          geographical order. And since my native land furnishes as apt
          instances of the superstition as any other, we may start on our
          round from Scotland.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Atlantic
          Ocean, about six leagues to the west of Gallon Head in the Lewis,
          lies a small group of rocky islets known as the Flannan Islands.
          Sheep and wild fowl are now their only inhabitants, but remains of
          what are described as Druidical temples and the title of the Sacred
          Isles given them by Buchanan suggest that in days gone by piety or
          superstition may have found a safe retreat from the turmoil of the
          world in these remote solitudes, where the dashing of the waves and
          the strident scream of the sea-birds are almost the only sounds
          that break the silence. Once a year, in summer-time, the
          inhabitants of the adjacent lands of the Lewis, who have a right to
          these islands, cross over to them to fleece their sheep and kill
          the wild fowl for the sake both of their flesh and their feathers.
          They regard the islands as invested with a certain sanctity, and
          have been heard to say that none ever yet landed in them but found
          himself more <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg
          393]</span><a name="Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          disposed to devotion there than anywhere else. Accordingly the
          fowlers who go thither are bound, during the whole of the time that
          they ply their business, to observe very punctiliously certain
          quaint customs, the transgression of which would be sure, in their
          opinion, to entail some serious inconvenience. When they have
          landed and fastened their boat to the side of a rock, they clamber
          up into the island by a wooden ladder, and no sooner are they got
          to the top, than they all uncover their heads and make a turn
          sun-ways round about, thanking God for their safety. On the biggest
          of the islands are the ruins of a chapel dedicated to St. Flannan.
          When the men come within about twenty paces of the altar, they all
          strip themselves of their upper garments at once and betake
          themselves to their devotions, praying thrice before they begin
          fowling. On the first day the first prayer is offered as they
          advance towards the chapel on their knees; the second is said as
          they go round the chapel; and the third is said in or hard by the
          ruins. They also pray thrice every evening, and account it unlawful
          to kill a fowl after evening prayers, as also to kill a fowl at any
          time with a stone. Another ancient custom forbids the crew to carry
          home in the boat any suet of the sheep they slaughter in the
          islands, however many they may kill. But what here chiefly concerns
          us is that so long as they stay on the islands they are strictly
          forbidden to use certain common words, and are obliged to
          substitute others for them. Thus it is absolutely unlawful to call
          the island of St. Kilda, which lies thirty leagues to the
          southward, by its proper Gaelic name of Hirt; they must call it
          only <span class="tei tei-q">“the high country.”</span> They may
          not so much as once name the islands in which they are fowling by
          the ordinary name of Flannan; they must speak only of <span class=

          prevails much more on the east coast than on the west, where it may
          be said to be generally extinct. It is reported to be carefully
          observed by the fishermen about the Cromarty Firth.<a id=

          Among the words tabooed by fishermen in the north of Scotland when
          they are at sea are minister, salmon, hare, rabbit, rat, pig, and
          porpoise. At the present day if some of the boats that come to the
          herring-fishing at Wick should meet a salmon-boat from Reay in
          Caithness, the herring-men will not speak to, nor even look at, the
          salmon-fishers.<a id="noteref_1455" name="noteref_1455" href=

          fishermen are at sea, they employ a nomenclature peculiar to the

          The substituted terms are mostly of Norwegian origin, for the

          the north-east coast of Scotland there are some villages, of which
          the inhabitants never pronounce certain words and family names when
          they are at sea; each village has its peculiar aversion to one or
          more of these words, among which are <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“minister,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“kirk,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“swine,”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“salmon,”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id="Pg395" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“trout,”</span> and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“dog.”</span> When a church has to be
          referred to, as often happens, since some of the churches serve as
          land-marks to the fishermen at sea, it is spoken of as the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“bell-hoose”</span> instead of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“kirk.”</span> A minister is called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the man wi' the black quyte.”</span> It is
          particularly unlucky to utter the word <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sow”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“swine”</span>
          or <span class="tei tei-q">“pig”</span> while the line is being
          baited; if any one is foolish enough to do so, the line is sure to
          be lost. In some villages on the coast of Fife a fisherman who
          hears the ill-omened word spoken will cry out <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Cold iron.”</span> In the village of Buckie there are
          some family names, especially Ross, and in a less degree Coull,
          which no fisherman will pronounce. If one of these names be
          mentioned in the hearing of a fisherman, he spits or, as he calls
          it, <span class="tei tei-q">“chiffs.”</span> Any one who bears the
          dreaded name is called a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“chiffer-oot,”</span> and is referred to only by a
          circumlocution such as <span class="tei tei-q">“The man it diz so
          in so,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“the laad it lives at
          such and such a place.”</span> During the herring-season men who
          are unlucky enough to inherit the tabooed names have little chance
          of being hired in the fishing-boats; and sometimes, if they have
          been hired before their names were known, they have been refused
          their wages at the end of the season, because the boat in which
          they sailed had not been successful, and the bad luck was set down
          to their presence in it.<a id="noteref_1458" name="noteref_1458"
          href="#note_1458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Although in Scotland superstitions of this kind appear to be
          specially incident to the callings of fishermen and fowlers, other
          occupations are not exempt from them. Thus in the Outer Hebrides
          the fire of a kiln is not called fire (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">teine</span></span>) but <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">aingeal</span></span>. Such a fire, it is
          said, is a dangerous thing, and ought not to be referred to except
          by a euphemism. <span class="tei tei-q">“Evil be to him who called
          it fire or who named fire in the kiln. It was considered the next
          thing to setting it on fire.”</span><a id="noteref_1459" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1459</span></span></a>
          Again, in some districts of Scotland a brewer would have resented
          the use of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“water”</span> in
          reference to the work in which he was engaged. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Water be your part of it,”</span> was the common
          retort. It was supposed that the use of the word would spoil the
          brewing.<a id="noteref_1460" name="noteref_1460" href=

          396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          that when you meet a hobgoblin, and the fiend asks what is the name
          of your dirk, you should not call it a dirk (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "font-style: italic">piuthar mo sheanamhair</span></span>) or by
          some similar title. If you do not observe this precaution, the
          goblin will lay such an enchantment on the blade that you will be
          unable to stab him with it; the dirk will merely make a tinkling
          noise against the soft impalpable body of the fiend.<a id=

          According to the Swedish popular belief, there are certain animals
          which should never be spoken of by their proper names, but must
          always be signified by euphemisms and kind allusions to their
          character. Thus, if you speak slightingly of the cat or beat her,
          you must be sure not to mention her name; for she belongs to the
          hellish crew, and is a friend of the mountain troll, whom she often
          visits. Great caution is also needed in talking of the cuckoo, the
          owl, and the magpie, for they are birds of witchery. The fox must
          be called <span class="tei tei-q">“blue-foot,”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“he that goes in the forest”</span>; and
          rats are <span class="tei tei-q">“the long-bodied,”</span> mice
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the small grey,”</span> and the seal
          <span class="tei tei-q">“brother Lars.”</span> Swedish herd-girls,
          again, believe that if the wolf and the bear be called by other
          than their proper and legitimate names, they will not attack the
          herd. Hence they give these brutes names which they fancy will not
          hurt their feelings. The number of endearing appellations lavished
          by them on the wolf is legion; they call him <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“golden tooth,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          silent one,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“grey legs,”</span> and
          so on; while the bear is referred to by the respectful titles of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the old man,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“grandfather,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“twelve
          men's strength,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“golden
          feet,”</span> and more of the same sort. Even inanimate things are
          not always to be called by their usual names. For instance, fire is
          sometimes to be called <span class="tei tei-q">“heat”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hetta</span></span>) not <span class=

          Natives of Travancore are careful not to speak disrespectfully of

          only scruple to mention certain animals in the morning. Thus, the

          to these animals at that time, they call them by special names. For
          instance, they call the hare <span class="tei tei-q">“the

          to a monkey or a bear in the morning, they speak of the monkey as

          <span class="tei tei-q">“the eater of white ants.”</span> They
          would not mention a crocodile. Among the Pataris the matutinal

          have also to observe a number of other taboos, particularly in the

          and to smear his forehead with lime. This is a sign to the guardian
          spirit of the tree, who accordingly carries away the soul of the
          sleeper to the land of the dead by means of a fever or other

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At certain
          seasons of the year parties of Jakuns and Binuas go out to seek for
          camphor in the luxuriant forests of their native country, which is
          the narrow southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, the Land's
          End of Asia. They are absent for three or four months together, and
          during the whole of this time the use of the ordinary Malay
          language is forbidden to them, and they have to speak a special
          language called by them the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bassa
          kapor</span></span> (camphor language) or <span class=

          <span style="font-style: italic">kapur</span></span>. Indeed not
          only have the searchers to employ this peculiar language, but even
          the men and women who stay at home in the villages are obliged to
          speak it while the others are away looking for the camphor. They
          believe that a spirit presides over the camphor trees, and that
          without propitiating him they could not obtain the precious gum;
          the shrill cry of a species of cicada, heard at night, is supposed
          to be the voice of the spirit. If they failed to employ the camphor
          language, they think that they would have great difficulty in
          finding the camphor trees, and that even when they did find them
          the camphor would not yield itself up to the collector. The camphor
          language consists in great part of words which are either Malayan
          or of Malay origin; but it also contains many words which are not
          Malayan but are presumed to be remains of the original Jakun
          dialects now almost extinct in these districts. The words derived
          from Malayan are formed in many cases by merely substituting a
          descriptive phrase for the common term. Thus instead of rice they
          say <span class="tei tei-q">“grass fruit”</span>; instead of gun
          they say <span class="tei tei-q">“far sounding”</span>; the epithet
          <span class="tei tei-q">“short-legged”</span> is substituted for
          hog; hair is referred to as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“leaves,”</span> and so on.<a id="noteref_1516" name=
          "noteref_1516" href="#note_1516"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1516</span></span></a> So
          when the Battas or Bataks of Sumatra have gone out to search for
          camphor, they must abandon the speech of daily life as soon as they
          reach the camphor <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg
          406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          forest. For example, if they wish to speak of the forest they may
          not use the ordinary word for it (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hoetan</span></span>), but must call it
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kerrengettetdoeng</span></span>. When they
          have fixed on a spot in which to try their luck, they set up a
          booth and clear a space in front of it to serve as a place of
          sacrifice. Here, after summoning the camphor spirit (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">berroe ni
          kapoer</span></span>) by playing on a flute, they offer sacrifice
          to him repeatedly. Then they lie down to dream of the place where
          camphor is to be found. If this succeeds, the leader goes and
          chooses the tree. When it has been cut down to the accompaniment of
          certain spells or incantations, one of the men runs and wraps the
          top of the fallen tree in a garment to prevent the camphor from
          escaping from the trunk before they have secured it. Then the tree
          is cleft and split up in the search for the camphor crystals, which
          are to be found in the fibres of the wood.<a id="noteref_1517"
          name="noteref_1517" href="#note_1517"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1517</span></span></a>
          Similarly, when the Kayans of Borneo are searching for camphor,
          they talk a language invented solely for their use at this time.
          The camphor itself is never mentioned by its proper name, but is
          always referred to as <span class="tei tei-q">“the thing that
          smells”</span>; and all the tools employed in collecting the drug
          receive fanciful names. Unless they conform to this rule they
          suppose that the camphor crystals, which are found only in the
          crevices of the wood, will elude them.<a id="noteref_1518" name=
          "noteref_1518" href="#note_1518"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1518</span></span></a> The
          Malanau tribes of Borneo observe the same custom very strictly,
          believing that the crystals would immediately dissolve if they
          spoke anything but the camphor language. For example, the common
          Malanau word for <span class="tei tei-q">“return”</span> is
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">muli</span></span>, but in presence of a
          camphor tree they say <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">beteku</span></span>. Again, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to hide”</span> is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">palim</span></span> in the Malanau language,
          but when they are looking for camphor they say <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">krian</span></span>. In like manner, all
          common names for implements and food are exchanged for others. In
          some tribes the camphor-seekers may never mention the names of
          chiefs and influential men; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class=

          underground. Ore of inferior quality is excused on the score of its
          tender years; it will no doubt improve as it grows older. Not only
          is the tin believed to be under the protection and command of
          certain spirits who must be propitiated, but it is even supposed to
          have its own special likes and dislikes for certain persons and
          things. Hence the Malays deem it advisable to treat tin ore with
          respect, to consult its convenience, nay, to conduct the business
          of mining in such a way that the ore may, as it were, be extracted
          without its own knowledge. When such are their ideas about the
          mineral it is no wonder that the miners scruple to employ certain
          words in the mines, and replace them by others which are less
          likely to give offence to the ore or its guardian spirits. Thus,
          for example, the elephant must not be called an elephant but
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the tall one who turns himself
          about”</span>; and in like manner special words, different from
          those in common use, are employed by the miners to designate the
          cat, the buffalo, the snake, the centipede, tin sand, metallic tin,
          and lemons. Lemons are particularly distasteful to the spirits;
          they may not be brought into the mines.<a id="noteref_1520" name=

          Again, the Malay wizard, who is engaged in snaring pigeons with the
          help of a decoy-bird and a calling-tube, must on no account call
          things by their common names. The tiny conical hut, in which he
          sits waiting for the wild pigeons to come fluttering about him,
          goes by the high-sounding name of the Magic Prince, perhaps with a
          delicate allusion to its noble inmate. The calling-tube is known as
          Prince <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg
          408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Distraction, doubtless on account of the extraordinary fascination
          it exercises on the birds. The decoy-pigeon receives the name of
          the Squatting Princess, and the rod with a noose at the end of it,
          which serves to catch the unwary birds, is disguised under the
          title of Prince Invitation. Everything, in fact, is on a princely
          scale, so far at least as words can make it so. The very nooses
          destined to be slipped over the necks or legs of the little
          struggling prisoners are dignified by the title of King Solomon's
          necklaces and armlets; and the trap into which the birds are
          invited to walk is variously described as King Solomon's Audience
          Chamber, or a Palace Tower, or an Ivory Hall carpeted with silver
          and railed with amalgam. What pigeon could resist these manifold
          attractions, especially when it is addressed by the respectful
          title of Princess Kapor or Princess Sarap or Princess Puding?<a id=
          "noteref_1521" name="noteref_1521" href="#note_1521"><span class=

          Again, the fisher-folk on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula,
          like their brethren in Scotland, are reluctant to mention the names
          of birds or beasts while they are at sea. All animals then go by
          the name of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cheweh</span></span>, a meaningless word which
          is believed not to be understood by the creatures to whom it
          refers. Particular kinds of animals are distinguished by
          appropriate epithets; the pig is <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          grunting <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cheweh</span></span>,”</span> the buffalo is
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cheweh</span></span> that says <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">uak</span></span>,”</span> the snipe is
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cheweh</span></span> that cries <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kek-kek</span></span>,”</span> and so
          on.<a id="noteref_1522" name="noteref_1522" href=
          "#note_1522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1522</span></span></a> In
          this respect the fishermen of Patani Bay class together sea
          spirits, Buddhist monks, beasts, and reptiles; these are all
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cheweh</span></span> and their common names
          may not be mentioned at sea. But, curiously enough, they lay no
          such embargo on the names of fish and birds, except the vulture and
          domestic fowls and ducks. At sea the vulture is named <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“bald head,”</span> the tiger <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“striped,”</span> the snake <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“weaver's sword,”</span> the horse <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“fast,”</span> and a species of monkey <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“long tail.”</span> The human foot is called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“tortoise,”</span> and a Buddhist monk
          <span class="tei tei-q">“yellow”</span> on account of the colour of
          his robe. These Malay fishermen are at least as unwilling to speak
          of a Buddhist monk at sea as Scotch fishermen are to mention a
          minister in similar circumstances. If one of them mentions a monk,
          his mates will fall on him and beat him; whereas for other slips of
          the tongue they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg
          409]</span><a name="Pg409" id="Pg409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          think it enough to throw a little bilge-water over the back of the
          transgressor and to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“May the ill-luck
          be dismissed!”</span> The use of this special language is even more
          obligatory by night than by day. On shore the fishermen make very
          merry over those lubberly landsmen who cannot talk correctly at
          sea.<a id="noteref_1523" name="noteref_1523" href=
          "#note_1523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1523</span></span></a> In
          like manner Achinese fishermen, in northern Sumatra, employ a
          special vocabulary when they are at sea. Thus they may not call a
          mountain a mountain, or mountain-high billows would swamp the boat;
          they refer to it as <span class="tei tei-q">“high ground.”</span>
          They may not speak of an elephant by its proper name of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gadjah</span></span>, but must call it
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pò
          meurah</span></span>. If a man wishes to say that something is
          clear, he must not use the ordinary word for clear (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">lheuëh</span></span>) because it bears the
          meaning also of <span class="tei tei-q">“free,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“loose”</span>; and the utterance of such a word might
          enable the fish to get free from the net and escape. Instead of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">lheuëh</span></span> he must therefore employ
          the less dangerous synonym <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">leungka</span></span>. In like manner, we are
          told, among the fishermen of the north coast of Java whole lists of
          words might be compiled which are tabooed at sea and must be
          replaced by others.<a id="noteref_1524" name="noteref_1524" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Sumatra the
          spirits of the gold mines are treated with as much deference as the
          spirits of the tin-mines in the Malay Peninsula. Tin, ivory, and
          the like may not be brought by the miners to the scene of their
          operations, for at the scent of such things the spirits of the mine
          would cause the gold to vanish. For the same reason it is forbidden
          to refer to certain things by their proper names, and in speaking
          of them the miners must use other words. In some cases, for example
          in removing the grains of the gold, a deep silence must be
          observed; no commands may be given or questions asked,<a id=

          probably because the removal of the precious metal is regarded as a
          theft which the spirits would punish if they caught the thieves in
          the act. Certainly the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg
          410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Dyaks believe that gold has a soul which seeks to avenge itself on
          men who dig the precious metal. But the angry spirit is powerless
          to harm miners who observe certain precautions, such as never to
          bathe in a river with their faces turned up stream, never to sit
          with their legs dangling, and never to tie up their hair.<a id=

          Again, a Sumatran who fancies that there is a tiger or a crocodile
          in his neighbourhood, will speak of the animal by the honourable
          title of <span class="tei tei-q">“grandfather”</span> for the
          purpose of propitiating the creature.<a id="noteref_1527" name=

          Among the Gayos of Sumatra it is forbidden to mention the name of
          small-pox in the house of a man who is suffering from the disease;
          and the words for ugly, red, stinking, unlucky, and so forth are
          forbidden under the same circumstances. The disease is referred to
          under the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“prince of the averters

          long as the hunting season lasts, the natives of Nias may not name
          the eye, the hammer, stones, and in some places the sun by their
          true names; no smith may ply his trade in the village, and no
          person may go from one village to another to have smith's work done
          for him. All this, with the exception of the rule about not naming
          the eye and the sun, is done to prevent the dogs from growing
          stiff, and so losing the power of running down the game.<a id=

          During the rice-harvest in Nias the reapers seldom speak to each
          other, and when they do so, it is only in whispers. Outside the
          field they must speak of everything by names different from those
          in common use, which gives rise to a special dialect or jargon
          known as <span class="tei tei-q">“field speech.”</span> It has been
          observed that some of the words in this jargon <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> resemble words in the language of the
          Battas of Sumatra.<a id="noteref_1531" name="noteref_1531" href=
          "#note_1531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1531</span></span></a>
          While these rice-reapers of Nias are at work they may not address
          each other by their names; they must use only such general terms as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“man,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“woman,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“girl,”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“old man,”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“old woman.”</span> The word for <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“fire”</span> may not pass their lips; instead of it
          they must use the word for <span class="tei tei-q">“cold.”</span>
          Other words tabooed to them during the harvest are the words for
          <span class="tei tei-q">“smoke”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“stone.”</span> If a reaper wishes to ask another for
          his whetstone to sharpen his knife, he must speak of it as a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“fowl's egg.”</span><a id="noteref_1532"
          name="noteref_1532" href="#note_1532"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1532</span></span></a> In
          Java when people suspect that a tiger or crocodile is near, they
          avoid the use of the proper name of the beast and refer to him as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the old lord”</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“grandfather.”</span> Similarly, men who are watching a
          plantation to protect it from wild boars speak of these animals as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“handsome men”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">wong
          bagus</span></span>). When after harvest the unhusked rice is to be
          brought into the barn, the barn is not called a barn but
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the dark store-house.”</span> Serious
          epidemics may not be mentioned by their true names; thus smallpox
          is called the <span class="tei tei-q">“pretty girl”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">lara bagus</span></span>). The Javanese are
          particularly careful to eschew certain common words at evening or
          night. Thus the snake is then called a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“tree-root”</span>; the venomous centipede is referred
          to as the <span class="tei tei-q">“red ant”</span>; oil is spoken
          of as <span class="tei tei-q">“water”</span>; and so forth. And
          when leaves and herbs are being gathered for use in medicine they
          are regularly designated by other than their ordinary names.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Alfoors or
          Toradjas of Poso, in Celebes, are forbidden by custom to speak the
          ordinary language when they are at work in the harvest-field. At
          such times they employ a secret language which is said to agree
          with the ordinary one only in this, that in it some things are
          designated by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg
          412]</span><a name="Pg412" id="Pg412" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          words usually applied in a different sense, or by descriptive
          phrases or circumlocutions. Thus instead of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“run”</span> they say <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“limp”</span>; instead of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“hand”</span> they say <span class="tei tei-q">“that
          with which one reaches”</span>; instead of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“foot”</span> they say <span class="tei tei-q">“that
          with which one limps”</span>; and instead of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“ear”</span> they say <span class="tei tei-q">“that
          with which one hears.”</span> Again, in the field-speech
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to drink”</span> becomes <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to thrust forward the mouth”</span>; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to pass by”</span> is expressed by <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to nod with the head”</span>; a gun is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“a fire-producer”</span>; and wood is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that which is carried on the shoulder.”</span> The
          writer who reports the custom was formerly of opinion that this
          secret language was designed to avoid attracting the attention of
          evil spirits to the ripe rice; but further enquiry has satisfied
          him that the real reason for adopting it is a wish not to frighten
          the soul of the rice by revealing to it the alarming truth that it
          is about to be cut, carried home, boiled, and eaten. It is just the
          words referring to these actions, he tells us, which are especially
          tabooed and replaced by others. Beginning with a rule of avoiding a
          certain number of common words, the custom has grown among people
          of the Malay stock till it has produced a complete language for use
          in the fields. In Minahassa also this secret field-speech consists
          in part of phrases or circumlocutions, of which many are said to be
          very poetical.<a id="noteref_1534" name="noteref_1534" href=

          it is not only on the harvest field that the Toradja resorts to the
          use of a secret language from superstitious motives. In the great
          primaeval forest he feels ill at ease, for well he knows the
          choleric temper of the spirits who inhabit the giant trees of the
          wood, and that were he to excite their wrath they would assuredly
          pay him out in one way or other, it might be by carrying off his
          soul and so making him ill, it might be by crushing him flat under
          a falling tree. These touchy beings particularly dislike to hear
          certain words pronounced, and accordingly on his way through the
          forest the Toradja takes care to avoid the offensive terms and to
          substitute others for them. Thus he will not call a dog a dog, but
          refers to it as <span class="tei tei-q">“the hairy one”</span>; a
          buffalo is spoken of as <span class="tei tei-q">“thick
          hide”</span>; a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg
          413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          cooking pot becomes <span class="tei tei-q">“that which is set
          down”</span>; the hair of the head is alluded to as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“betel”</span>; goats and pigs are <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the folk under the house”</span>; a horse is
          <span class="tei tei-q">“long nose”</span>; and deer are
          <span class="tei tei-q">“denizens of the fell.”</span> If he is
          rash or careless enough to utter a forbidden word in the forest, a
          short-tempered tree-spirit will fetch him such a bang on the head
          that the blood will spout from his nose and mouth.<a id=

          Again, when the weather is fine and the Toradja wishes it to
          continue so, he is careful not to utter the word <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“rain,”</span> for if he did so the rain would fancy he
          was called for and would obligingly present himself. Indeed, in the
          district of Pakambia, which is frequently visited by heavy storms,
          the word <span class="tei tei-q">“rain”</span> may not be mentioned
          throughout the year lest it should provoke a tempest; the
          unmentionable thing is there delicately alluded to as <span class=

          or Macassar man is at sea and sailing past a place which he
          believes to be haunted by evil spirits, he keeps as quiet as he
          can; but if he is obliged to speak he designates common things and
          actions, such as water, wind, fire, cooking, eating, the rice-pot,
          and so forth, by peculiar terms which are neither Bugineese nor
          Macassar, and therefore cannot be understood by the evil spirits,

          However, according to another and later account given by the same

          inhabitants of Ternate and of the Sangi Islands deem it very
          dangerous to point at distant objects or to name them while they
          are at sea. Once while sailing with a crew of Ternate men a
          European asked one of them the name of certain small islands which
          they had passed. The man had been talkative before, but the
          question reduced him to silence. <span class=

          Sangi Islanders have, besides the ordinary language, an ancient one
          which is only partly understood by some of the people. This old

          "tei tei-q">“There are many leaves fallen here,”</span> meaning
          that there are many fish in the river. And they will not breathe
          the name of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> whom his fancy endows with human
          intelligence; and hence he avoids certain words and substitutes
          others in their stead, either from a desire to soothe and
          propitiate these beings by speaking well of them, or from a dread
          that they may understand his speech and know what he is about, when
          he happens to be engaged in that which, if they knew of it, would
          excite their anger or their fear. Hence the substituted terms fall
          into two classes according as they are complimentary or enigmatic;
          and these expressions are employed, according to circumstances, for
          different and even opposite reasons, the complimentary because they
          will be understood and appreciated, and the enigmatic because they
          will not. We can now see why persons engaged in occupations like
          fishing, fowling, hunting, mining, reaping, and sailing the sea,
          should abstain from the use of the common language and veil their
          meaning in strange words and dark phrases. For they have this in
          common that all of them are encroaching on the domain of the
          elemental beings, the creatures who, whether visible or invisible,
          whether clothed in fur or scales or feathers, whether manifesting
          themselves in tree or stone or running stream or breaking wave, or
          hovering unseen in the air, may be thought to have the first right
          to those regions of earth and sea and sky into which man intrudes
          only to plunder and destroy. Thus deeply imbued with a sense of the
          all-pervading life and intelligence of nature, man at a certain
          stage of his intellectual development cannot but be visited with
          fear or compunction, whether he is killing wild fowl among the
          stormy Hebrides, or snaring doves in the sultry thickets of the
          Malay Peninsula; whether he is hunting the bear in Lapland snows,
          or the tiger in Indian jungles, or hauling in the dripping net,
          laden with silvery herring, on the coast of Scotland; whether he is
          searching for the camphor crystals in the shade of the tropical
          forest, or extracting the red gold from the darksome mine, or
          laying low with a sweep of his sickle the yellow ears on the
          harvest field. In all these his depredations on nature, man's first
          endeavour apparently is by quietness and silence to escape the
          notice of the beings whom he dreads; but if that cannot be, he puts
          the best face he can on the matter by dissembling his foul designs
          under a fair exterior, by flattering the <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> creatures whom he proposes to betray, and by
          so guarding his lips, that, though his dark ambiguous words are
          understood well enough by his fellows, they are wholly
          unintelligible to his victims. He pretends to be what he is not,
          and to be doing something quite different from the real business in
          hand. He is not, for example, a fowler catching pigeons in the
          forest; he is a Magic Prince or King Solomon himself<a id=

          inviting fair princesses into his palace tower or ivory hall. Such
          childish pretences suffice to cheat the guileless creatures whom
          the savage intends to rob or kill, perhaps they even impose to some
          extent upon himself; for we can hardly dissever them wholly from
          those forms of sympathetic magic in which primitive man seeks to
          effect his purpose by imitating the thing he desires to produce, or
          even by assimilating himself to it. It is hard indeed for us to
          realise the mental state of a Malay wizard masquerading before wild
          pigeons in the character of King Solomon; yet perhaps the
          make-believe of children and of the stage, where we see the players
          daily forgetting their real selves in their passionate
          impersonation of the shadowy realm of fancy, may afford us some
          glimpse into the workings of that instinct of imitation or mimicry
          which is deeply implanted in the constitution of the human
          mind.</p>

            whom the welfare of the community is believed to depend, are
            obliged to observe many rules to ensure their own safety and that
            of their people.</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be easy
        to extend the list of royal and priestly taboos, but the instances
        collected in the preceding pages may suffice as specimens. To
        conclude this part of our subject it only remains to state summarily
        the general conclusions to which our enquiries have thus far
        conducted us. We have seen that in savage or barbarous society there
        are often found men to whom the superstition of their fellows
        ascribes a controlling influence over the general course of nature.
        Such men are accordingly adored and treated as gods. Whether these
        human divinities also hold temporal sway over the lives and fortunes
        of their adorers, or whether their functions are purely spiritual and
        supernatural, in other words, whether they are kings as well as gods
        or only the latter, is a distinction which hardly concerns us here.
        Their supposed divinity is the essential fact with which we have to
        deal. In virtue of it they are a pledge and guarantee to their
        worshippers of the continuance and orderly succession of those
        physical phenomena upon which mankind depends for subsistence.
        Naturally, therefore, the life and health of such a god-man are
        matters of anxious concern to the people whose welfare and even
        existence are bound up with his; naturally he is constrained by them
        to conform to such rules as the wit of early man has devised for
        averting the ills to which flesh is heir, including the last ill,
        death. These rules, as an examination of them has shewn, are nothing
        but the maxims with which, on the primitive view, every man of common
        prudence must comply if he would live long in the land. But while in
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg 420]</span><a name=
        "Pg420" id="Pg420" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> case of ordinary men
        the observance of the rules is left to the choice of the individual,
        in the case of the god-man it is enforced under penalty of dismissal
        from his high station, or even of death. For his worshippers have far
        too great a stake in his life to allow him to play fast and loose
        with it. Therefore all the quaint superstitions, the old-world
        maxims, the venerable saws which the ingenuity of savage philosophers
        elaborated long ago, and which old women at chimney corners still
        impart as treasures of great price to their descendants gathered
        round the cottage fire on winter evenings—all these antique fancies
        clustered, all these cobwebs of the brain were spun about the path of
        the old king, the human god, who, immeshed in them like a fly in the
        toils of a spider, could hardly stir a limb for the threads of
        custom, <span class="tei tei-q">“light as air but strong as links of
        iron,”</span> that crossing and recrossing each other in an endless
        maze bound him fast within a network of observances from which death
        or deposition alone could release him.</p>

        of the past the life of the old kings and priests teems with
        instruction. In it was summed up all that passed for wisdom when the
        world was young. It was the perfect pattern after which every man
        strove to shape his life; a faultless model constructed with rigorous
        accuracy upon the lines laid down by a barbarous philosophy. Crude
        and false as that philosophy may seem to us, it would be unjust to
        deny it the merit of logical consistency. Starting from a conception
        of the vital principle as a tiny being or soul existing in, but
        distinct and separable from, the living being, it deduces for the
        practical guidance of life a system of rules which in general hangs
        well together and forms a fairly complete and harmonious whole.<a id=

        flaw—and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421">[pg
        421]</span><a name="Pg421" id="Pg421" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it
        is a fatal one—of the system lies not in its reasoning, but in its
        premises; in its conception of the nature of life, not in any
        irrelevancy of the conclusions which it draws from that conception.
        But to stigmatise these premises as ridiculous because we can easily
        detect their falseness, would be ungrateful as well as
        unphilosophical. We stand upon the foundation reared by the
        generations that have gone before, and we can but dimly realise the
        painful and prolonged efforts which it has cost humanity to struggle
        up to the point, no very exalted one after all, which we have
        reached. Our gratitude is due to the nameless and forgotten toilers,
        whose patient thought and active exertions have largely made us what
        we are. The amount of new knowledge which one age, certainly which
        one man, can add to the common store is small, and it argues
        stupidity or dishonesty, besides ingratitude, to ignore the heap
        while vaunting the few grains which it may have been our privilege to
        add to it. There is indeed little danger at present of undervaluing
        the contributions which modern times and even classical antiquity
        have made to the general advancement of our race. But when we pass
        these limits, the case is different. Contempt and ridicule or
        abhorrence and denunciation are too often the only recognition
        vouchsafed to the savage and his ways. Yet of the benefactors whom
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg 422]</span><a name="Pg422"
        id="Pg422" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> we are bound thankfully to
        commemorate, many, perhaps most, were savages. For when all is said
        and done our resemblances to the savage are still far more numerous
        than our differences from him; and what we have in common with him,
        and deliberately retain as true and useful, we owe to our savage
        forefathers who slowly acquired by experience and transmitted to us
        by inheritance those seemingly fundamental ideas which we are apt to
        regard as original and intuitive. We are like heirs to a fortune
        which has been handed down for so many ages that the memory of those
        who built it up is lost, and its possessors for the time being regard
        it as having been an original and unalterable possession of their
        race since the beginning of the world. But reflection and enquiry
        should satisfy us that to our predecessors we are indebted for much
        of what we thought most our own, and that their errors were not
        wilful extravagances or the ravings of insanity, but simply
        hypotheses, justifiable as such at the time when they were
        propounded, but which a fuller experience has proved to be
        inadequate. It is only by the successive testing of hypotheses and
        rejection of the false that truth is at last elicited. After all,
        what we call truth is only the hypothesis which is found to work
        best. Therefore in reviewing the opinions and practices of ruder ages
        and races we shall do well to look with leniency upon their errors as
        inevitable slips made in the search for truth, and to give them the
        benefit of that indulgence which we ourselves may one day stand in
        need of; <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          The Japanese word for god or deity is <span lang="ja" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kami</span></span>. It is thus explained by
          the native scholar Motoöri, one of the chief authorities on
          Japanese religion: <span class="tei tei-q">“The term <span lang=
          "ja" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kami</span></span> is applied in the first
          place to the various deities of Heaven and Earth who are mentioned
          in the ancient records as well as their spirits (<span lang="ja"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mi-tama</span></span>) which reside in the
          shrines where they are worshipped. Moreover, not only human beings,
          but birds, beasts, plants and trees, seas and mountains, and all
          other things whatsoever which deserve to be dreaded and revered for
          the extraordinary and pre-eminent powers which they possess, are
          called <span lang="ja" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "ja"><span style="font-style: italic">Kami</span></span>. They need
          not be eminent for surpassing nobleness, goodness, or
          serviceableness alone. Malignant and uncanny beings are also called
          <span lang="ja" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kami</span></span> if only they are the
          objects of general dread. Among <span lang="ja" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kami</span></span> who are human beings I need
          hardly mention first of all the successive Mikados—with reverence
          be it spoken.... Then there have been numerous examples of divine
          human beings both in ancient and modern times, who, although not
          accepted by the nation generally, are treated as gods, each of his
          several dignity, in a single province, village, or family.”</span>
          Hirata, another native authority on Japanese religion, defines
          <span lang="ja" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kami</span></span> as a term which comprises
          all things strange, wondrous, and possessing <span lang="ja" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ja"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">isao</span></span> or virtue. And a recent
          dictionary gives the following definitions: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span lang="ja" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "ja"><span style="font-style: italic">Kami</span></span>. 1.
          Something which has no form but is only spirit, has unlimited
          supernatural power, dispenses calamity and good fortune, punishes
          crime and rewards virtue. 2. Sovereigns of all times, wise and
          virtuous men, valorous and heroic persons whose spirits are prayed
          to after their death. 3. Divine things which transcend human
          intellect. 4. The Christian God, Creator, Supreme Lord.”</span> See
          W. G. Aston, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Shinto</span></span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Way of the
          Gods</span></span>), pp. 8-10, from which the foregoing quotations
          are made. Mr. Aston himself considers that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the deification of living Mikados was titular rather
          than real,”</span> and he adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not
          aware that any specific so-called miraculous powers were
          authoritatively claimed for them”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.
          cit.</span></span> p. 41). No doubt it is very difficult for the
          Western mind to put itself at the point of view of the Oriental and
          to seize the precise point (if it can be said to exist) where the
          divine fades into the human or the human brightens into the divine.
          In translating, as we must do, the vague thought of a crude
          theology into the comparatively exact language of civilised Europe
          we must allow for a considerable want of correspondence between the
          two: we must leave between them, as it were, a margin of cloudland
          to which in the last resort the deity may retreat from the too
          searching light of philosophy and science.</dd>

          However, Mr. W. G. Aston tells us that Kaempfer's statements

          depended on (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          41, note †). M. Revon quotes Kaempfer's account with the
          observation that, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="fr" class=

          Kaempfer's description is very strongly confirmed by its close
          correspondence in detail with the similar customs and superstitions
          which have prevailed in regard to sacred personages in many other
          parts of the world and with which it is most unlikely that Kaempfer
          was acquainted. This correspondence will be brought out in the

          Among the Esquimaux of Smith Sound male mourners plug up the right

          point to a belief that the soul enters by one nostril and goes out
          by the other, and that the functions assigned to the right and left
          nostrils in this respect are reversed in men and women. Among the
          Esquimaux of Baffin land <span class="tei tei-q">“the person who

          that he may have swallowed it, as the other doctors were at first
          supposed to have done. With a view of testing this hypothesis they
          hold him up by the heels to empty out the soul; and as the water
          with which his head is washed may possibly contain the missing
          soul, it is poured on the patient's head to restore the soul to
          him. We have already seen that the recovered soul is often conveyed

          when a man had been stung by a scorpion, he was kept from sleeping
          for seven days, during which he had to wear a woman's bracelets and

          Researches</span></span> (Second Edition, London, 1832-1836), iv.
          388. Ellis appears to imply that the rule was universal in
          Polynesia, but perhaps he refers only to Hawaii, of which in this
          part of his work he is specially treating. We are told that in
          Hawaii the priest who carried the principal idol about the country
          was tabooed during the performance of this sacred office; he might
          not touch anything with his hands, and the morsels of food which he
          ate had to be put into his mouth by the chiefs of the villages
          through which he passed or even by the king himself, who
          accompanied the priest on his rounds (L. de Freycinet, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voyage autour du
          monde</span></span>, Historique, ii. Première Partie, Paris, 1829,
          p. 596). In Tonga the rule applied to chiefs only when their hands
          had become tabooed by touching a superior chief (W. Mariner,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tonga
          Islands</span></span>, i. 82 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          fed by slaves (A. S. Thomson, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">The Story of New Zealand</span></span>, i.
          102); or they may, like tabooed people in general, have taken up
          their food from little stages with their mouths or by means of
          fern-stalks (R. Taylor, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            rational motive. To convince us of this it is enough to remark
            that the rule is often observed by warriors for some time after
            their victorious return, and also by the persons left at home
            during the absence of the fighting men. In these cases the
            observance of the rule evidently does not admit of a rational
            explanation, which could hardly, indeed, be entertained by any
            one conversant with savage modes of thought. For examples, see

          puberty among some Indian tribes of British Columbia and by Creek
          lads at initiation. It is also observed by Kwakiutl Indians who
          have eaten human flesh (see below, p. <a href="#Pg189" class=

          other emblems of their religion might not scratch his body with his
          finger-nails, but carried a sharp stick in his hair which he used
          for this purpose. During the term of his priesthood he had to fast
          and practise strict continence. None but he dare handle the sacred
          pipe and emblems (W. W. Warren, <span class="tei tei-q">“History of

          In Vedic India the man who was about to offer the solemn sacrifice
          of soma prepared himself for his duties by a ceremony of
          consecration, during which he carried the horn of a black deer or
          antelope wherewith to scratch himself if necessary (<span class=

          Some of the Peruvian Indians used to prepare themselves for an
          important office by fasting, continence, and refusing to wash
          themselves, to comb their hair, and to put their hands to their
          heads; if they wished to scratch themselves, they must do it with a
          stick. See P. J. de Arriaga, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Extirpacion de la idolatria del
          Piru</span></span> (Lima, 1621), p. 20. Among the Isistines Indians
          of Paraguay mourners refrained from scratching their heads with
          their fingers, believing that to break the rule would make them
          bald, no hair growing on the part of the head which their fingers
          had touched. See Guevara, <span class="tei tei-q">“Historia del
          Paraguay,”</span> in P. de Angelis's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coleccion de obras y

          1836) p. 30. Amongst the Macusis of British Guiana, when a woman
          has given birth to a child, the father hangs up his hammock beside
          that of his wife and stays there till the navel-string drops off
          the child. During this time the parents have to observe certain
          rules, of which one is that they may not scratch their heads or
          bodies with their nails, but must use for this purpose a piece of
          palm-leaf. If they broke this rule, they think the child would die
          or be an invalid all its life. See R. Schomburgk, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Reisen in
          Britisch-Guiana</span></span>, ii. 314. Some aborigines of
          Queensland believe that if they scratched themselves with their
          fingers during a rain-making ceremony, no rain would fall. See
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Magic
          Art and the Evolution of Kings</span></span>, vol. i. p. 254. In
          all these cases, plainly, the hands are conceived to be so strongly
          infected with the venom of taboo that it is dangerous even for the
          owner of the hands to touch himself with them. The cowboy who
          herded the cows of the king of Unyoro had to live strictly chaste,
          no one might touch him, and he might not scratch or wound himself
          so as to draw blood. But it is not said that he was forbidden to
          touch himself with his own hands. See my <span class=

          (Herodotus, ii. 85; Diodorus Siculus, i. 91). Among some of the
          aboriginal tribes of Victoria and New South Wales widows wore a
          thick skullcap of clay or burned gypsum, forming a cast of the
          head, for some months after the death; when the period of mourning
          was over, the cap was removed, baked in the fire, and laid on the
          husband's grave. One of these widows' caps is exhibited in the

          (London, 1795), pp. 204-206. The custom of painting the face or the
          body of the manslayer, which may perhaps be intended to disguise
          him from the vengeful spirit of the slain, is practised by other
          peoples, as by the Nandi (see above, p. <a href="#Pg175" class=
          "tei tei-ref">175</a>). Among the Ba-Yaka of the Congo Free State a
          man who has been slain in battle is supposed to send his soul to
          avenge his death on his slayer; but the slayer can protect himself
          against the ghost by wearing the red tail-feathers of a parrot in
          his hair and painting his forehead red (E. Torday and T. A. Joyce,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Notes on the Ethnography of the
          Ba-Yaka,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Among the Borâna Gallas, when a war-party has returned to the
          village, the victors who have slain a foe are washed by the women
          with a mixture of fat and butter, and their faces are painted with
          red and white (Ph. Paulitschke, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ethnographie
          Nord-ost-Afrikas: die materielle Cultur der Danâkil, Galla und
          Somâl</span></span> (Berlin, 1893), p. 258). When Masai warriors
          kill enemies in fight they paint the right half of their own bodies
          red and the left half white (A. C. Hollis, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
          Masai</span></span>, p. 353). Among the Wagogo of German East
          Africa, a man who has killed an enemy in battle paints a red circle
          round his right eye and a black circle round his left eye (Rev. H.
          Cole, <span class="tei tei-q">“Notes on the Wagogo of German East
          Africa,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Institute</span></span>, xxxii. (1902) p. 314). Among the Angoni of
          central Africa, after a successful raid, the leader calls together
          all who have killed an enemy and paints their faces and heads
          white; also he paints a white band round the body under the arms
          and across the chest (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">British Central Africa Gazette</span></span>,
          No. 86, vol. v. No. 6 (April 30, 1898), p. 2). A Koossa Caffre who
          has slain a man is accounted unclean. He must roast some flesh on a
          fire kindled with wood of a special sort which imparts a bitter
          flavour to the meat. This flesh he eats, and afterwards blackens
          his face with the ashes of the fire. After a time he may wash
          himself, rinse his mouth with fresh milk, and paint himself brown
          again. From that moment he is clean (H. Lichtenstein, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Reisen im südlichen
          Africa</span></span>, i. 418). Among the Yabim of German New
          Guinea, when the relations of a murdered man have accepted a
          bloodwit instead of avenging his death, they must allow the family
          of the murderer to mark them with chalk on the brow. If this is not
          done, the ghost of their murdered kinsman may come and trouble them
          for not doing their duty by him; for example, he may drive away
          their swine or loosen their teeth (K. Vetter, in <span class=

          Kaiser Wilhelms-Land und den Bismarck-Archipel</span></span>, 1897,
          p. 99). In this last case the marking the face with chalk seems to
          be clearly a disguise to outwit the ghost.</dd>

          Some languages have retained a word for that general idea which

          too, arises the feeling among the wilder Indians, that if the

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          equivocal notion denoted by these terms that, whereas the condition
          of women in childbed is commonly regarded by the savage as what we
          should call unclean, among the Herero the same condition is
          described as holy; for some time after the birth of her child, the
          woman is secluded in a hut made specially for her, and every
          morning the milk of all the cows is brought to her that she may
          consecrate it by touching it with her mouth. See H. Schinz,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Again, whereas a girl at puberty is commonly secluded as dangerous,
          among the Warundi of eastern Africa she is led by her grandmother
          all over the house and obliged to touch everything (O. Baumann,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Durch

          reipublicae</span></span>, xxvi. 7. Plutarch here mentions that
          gold was also excluded from some temples. At first sight this is
          surprising, for in general neither the gods nor their ministers
          have displayed any marked aversion to gold. But a little enquiry
          suffices to clear up the mystery and set the scruple in its proper
          light. From a Greek inscription discovered some years ago we learn
          that no person might enter the sanctuary of the Mistress at
          Lycosura wearing golden trinkets, unless for the purpose of
          dedicating them to the goddess; and if any one did enter the holy
          place with such ornaments on his body but no such pious intention
          in his mind, the trinkets were forfeited to the use of religion.
          See Ἐφημερὶς ἀρχαιολογική (Athens, 1898), col. 249; Dittenberger,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sylloge
          inscriptionum Graecarum</span></span>,<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span>
          No. 939. The similar rule, that in the procession at the mysteries
          of Andania no woman might wear golden ornaments (Dittenberger,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.
          cit.</span></span> No. 653), was probably subject to a similar
          exception and enforced by a similar penalty. Once more, if the
          maidens who served Athena on the Acropolis at Athens put on gold
          ornaments, the ornaments became sacred, in other words, the
          property of the goddess (Harpocration, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.v.</span></span>
          ἀρρηφορεῖν, vol. i. p. 59, ed. Dindorf). Thus it appears that the
          pious scruple about gold was concerned rather with its exit from,
          than with its entrance into, the sacred edifice. At the sacrifice
          to the Sun in ancient Egypt worshippers were forbidden to wear
          golden trinkets and to give hay to an ass (Plutarch, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis et
          Osiris</span></span>, 30)—a singular combination of religious
          precepts. In India gold and silver are common totems, and members
          of such clans are forbidden to wear gold and silver trinkets
          respectively. See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          peoples, especially in Africa, regard the smith's craft with awe or
          fear as something uncanny and savouring of magic. Hence smiths are
          sometimes held in high honour, sometimes looked down upon with
          great contempt. These feelings probably spring in large measure
          from the superstitions which cluster round iron. See R. Andree,

          might not be poured out in libations to the gods which had been
          made either from grapes trodden with bleeding feet or from the
          clusters of a vine beside which a human body had hung in a noose
          (Pliny, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          blood from men, which is often done for purposes of decoration; and
          when a quarrel has taken place and men's blood has been spilt in

          the bodies of all who have died within a certain time are dug up
          and the decaying flesh scraped from the bones. See A. C. Kruijt,

          man does not pass down into the nether world until his body is
          decomposed or burnt. See J. Pelleschi, <span class=

          perhaps explain the widespread custom of disinterring the dead
          after a certain time and disposing of their bones otherwise.</dd>

          inscriptions we learn that the name might be made public after the
          priest's death. Further, a reference of Eunapius (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vitae
          sophistarum</span></span>, p. 475 of the Didot edition) shews that
          the name was revealed to the initiated. In the essay cited in the
          preceding note Mr. W. R. Paton assumes that it was the new and
          sacred name which was kept secret and committed to the sea. The
          case is not clear, but both the evidence and the probability seem
          to me in favour of the view that it was rather the old everyday
          name of the priest or priestess which was put away at his or her
          consecration. If, as is not improbable, these sacred personages had
          to act the parts of gods and goddesses at the mysteries, it might
          well be deemed indecorous and even blasphemous to recall the vulgar
          names by which they had been known in the familiar intercourse of
          daily life. If our clergy, to suppose an analogous case, had to
          personate the most exalted beings of sacred history, it would
          surely be grossly irreverent to address them by their ordinary
          names during the performance of their solemn functions.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">On this subject Mr. R. J. Wilkinson's
          account of the Malay's attitude to nature (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Malay
          Beliefs</span></span>, London and Leyden, 1906, pp. 67 <span class=

          deserves to be quoted: <span class="tei tei-q">“The practice of
          magic arts enters into every department of Malay life. If (as the
          people of the Peninsula believe) all nature is teeming with
          spiritual life, some spiritual weapon is necessary to protect man
          against possible ghostly foes. Now the chief and most
          characteristic weapon of the Malay in his fight against the
          invisible world is courtesy. The peasant will speak no evil of a
          tiger in the jungle or of an evil spirit within the limits of that
          spirit's authority.... The tiger is the symbol of kingly
          oppression; still, he is royal and must not be insulted; he is the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘shaggy-haired father’</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘grandfather’</span> of the traveller in
          the woods. Even the birds, the fish and the fruits that serve as
          human food are entitled to a certain consideration: the deer is
          addressed as a <span class="tei tei-q">‘prince,’</span> the
          coco-nut tree as a <span class="tei tei-q">‘princess,’</span> the
          chevrotin as <span class="tei tei-q">‘emperor of the jungle’</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">shah alam di-rimba</span></span>). In all this
          respect paid to unseen powers—for it is the soul of the animal or
          plant that is feared—there is no contemptible adulation or
          cringeing; the Malay believes that courtesy honours the speaker
          more than the person addressed.”</span></dd>

          the savage is not a blank; and when one becomes familiar with his
          beliefs and superstitions, and the complicated nature of his laws
          and customs, preconceived notions of his simplicity of thought go
          to the winds. I have yet to find that most apocryphal of beings
          described as the <span class="tei tei-q">‘unsophisticated
          African.’</span> We laugh at and ridicule his fetishes and
          superstitions, but we fail to follow the succession of ideas and
          effort of mind which have created these things. After most careful
          observations extending over nineteen years, I have come to the
          conclusion that there is nothing in the customs and fetishes of the
          African which does not represent a definite course of
          reasoning”</span> (Rev. Thomas Lewis, <span class="tei tei-q">“The

          "tei tei-q">“The study of primitive peoples is extremely curious
          and full of surprises. It is twenty years since I undertook it
          among the Thonga and Pedi tribes of South Africa, and the further I
          advance, the more I am astonished at the great number, the
          complexity, and the profundity of the rites of these so-called
          savages. Only a superficial observer could accuse their individual
          or tribal life of superficiality. If we take the trouble to seek
          the reason of these strange customs, we perceive that at their base
          there are secret, obscure reasons, principles hard to grasp, even
          though the most fervent adepts of the rite can give no account of
          it. To discover these principles, and so to give a true explanation
          of the rites, is the supreme task of the ethnographer,—a task in
          the highest degree delicate, for it is impossible to perform it if
          we do not lay aside our personal ideas to saturate ourselves with
          those of primitive peoples”</span> (Rev. H. A. Junod, <span class=

          words, the fruit of ripe experience, deserve to be pondered by
          those who fancy that the elaborate system of savage custom can have
          grown up instinctively without a correspondingly elaborate process
          of reasoning in the minds of its founders. We may not, indeed,
          always be able to discover the reason for which a particular custom
          or rite was instituted, for we are only beginning to understand the
          mind of uncivilised man; but all that we know of him tends to shew
          that his practice, however absurd it may seem to us, originated in
          a definite train of thought and for a definite and very practical
          purpose.</dd>

              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
